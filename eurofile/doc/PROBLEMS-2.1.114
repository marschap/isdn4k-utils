Known problems observed when using X.25 on top of isdn with kernel 2.1.126
==========================================================================

The X.25 PLP implementation was originally designed to be used on top
of a synchronous line (accessed via an X.25 network device driver)
or on top of lan (IEEE 802 LLC type 2). Furthermore, the X.25
implementation as well as the related isdn4linux extensions are labelled
as "EXPERIMENTAL" code in the kernel source tree. Thus, the X.25 protocol
sometimes doesn't behave as you would expect, in particular when used
on top of isdn.


Problems related to isdn drivers:
=================================

The isdnloop HL driver apparently has problems to re-establish a
connection that has been hung up from the outgoing device. You have to
unload the isdnloop driver after the faked isdn-connection is closed
and insmod it again. With the Hisax driver, this problem is not present.

When ifconfig'ing isdn network interfaces (with encap x25iface set) down,
"disconnect indication while unconfigured" messages might appear in
the syslog. This does not indicate any problem and can be ignored.

When establishing the first X.25 connection on a link, there is a
delay of some seconds until the link becomes established. This is only
a performance problem and harmless. Furthermore, this is fixed with
recent isdn4linux versions from the isdn4linux CVS tree.

Problems related to the X.25 PLP implementation:
================================================

isdn B channels are not closed automatically when the X.25 PLP
connection is closed. If you are lucky, your peer does it. Thus,
monitor your isdn connections while using X.25 on top of isdn4linux
(i.e. by watching syslog messages or by an isdn monitor program).
You need to close the B channel connection by hand (using the
"isdnctrl hangup" command) or rely on the isdn network interface's
hangup timeout. The scripts provided with this this test distribution
try to provide workourounds for this.

Kernels prior to 2.1.125 have a bug in include/linux/x25.h which
has been reported to cause compilation problems on glibc2 systems.

2.1.127 introduced changes that broke current i4l CVS isdn subsystem.
Until this is fixed, only use cvs isdn with 2.1.126 or older.
