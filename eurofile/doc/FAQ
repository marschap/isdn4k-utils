QUESTION: How can I control the amount of debugging output?
=========

ANSWER: 

The eftd server now also allows to
control the amount of debugging output via command line arguments,
refer to the eftd(8) man page for further info.

eftd.c and eftp.c contain a global variable tdu_stderr_mask.
Locate this and change the comment characters (/* .. */). For only
logging Error events, the final active statement should be

        tdu_stderr_mask = TDU_LOG_ERR | TDU_LOG_IER;

To remove isdnlog output to stderr, you can also comment out the
'tdu_open_isdtlog()' statement.



QUESTION: I don't want anonymous users to dial in without a MSN
=========
If a client without a MSN dials in, the ISDN number 0 is assumed.
With the line "guestservers 1* 2* 3* 4* 5* 6* 7* 8* 9*" in 
/etc/isdn/eftaccess connections with ISDN numbers beginning with 
"0" are refused. Don't forget the option "-a" for eftd to make him
the file /etc/isdn/eftaccess used.
(What's about international connections then? Do they begin with "0"?
I dont'n know, never had one...)
