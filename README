  isdnctrl,   general link-level setup utility.
  iprofd,     daemon for realizing AT&W0 on ttyI's.
  icnctrl,    setup utility for the icn driver.
  telesctrl,  setup utility for the teles driver.
  hisaxctrl,  setup utility for the HiSax driver.
  pcbitctl,   setup utility for the pcbit driver.
  avmcapictrl setup utility for the avmb1 driver.
  actctrl     setup utility for the act2000 driver.

2. Tools for monitoring activity:
  imon,       a ncurses based utility for monitoring ISDN-activities.
  imontty,    a tty based utility for monitoring ISDN-activities.
  isdnlog,    a set of utilities for connection logging.
  ipppstats   a utility for showing syncPPP statistics.
  xisdnload,  an xload-like meter.
  xmonisdn,   a utility for monitoring and controlling ISDN-activity.
  isdnmon,    a Tcl/Tk based utility for monitoring ISDN-activities.

3. Applications:
  vbox,       an answering machine/voice mailbox.
  ipppd,      daemon need for syncPPP and MPP.

4. Documentation:
  A very detailed FAQ and the generic manpages ttyI.4, isdninfo.4,

System prerequisites:

  To use this package, you need a kernel with an ISDN-subsystem configured.
  To get a such a kernel, take a clean standard-kernel (Version 2.0.31 or
  > 2.1.57 resp.) enable the isdn-related features you want and build the
  kernel as usual. If applicable some patches may be needed

  isdn-patches are available at

     ftp.franken.de:/pub/isdn4linux

  For using modularized parts of the ISDN-subsystem, newest modutils
  are strongly recommended.

3. Configuration, Compilation.

   Run "make config"

   This will run an interactive configuration tool and the various
   configuration-scripts for each sub-package. (You may know that
   tool from kernel menuconfig.)
   There is a global configuration directory, where most programs
   expect their configuration files. The default is /etc/isdn.

   - Alternatively you can edit the .config file by hand (once that
     has been created once with "make config"), and run "make subconfig"
     instead. This might be useful if you want to automate the building
     of the package, e.g. for a Red Hat rpm or a Debian deb.
   
   Run "make"

   This builds all previously selected utilities.

4. Installation

   For the following steps, root permissions are necessary

   Install the utilities, the man pages and config-files:

     make install

   The config files usually are installed in /etc/isdn if not
   specified otherwise during configuration.

5. Application

   The directory ./etc contains an example startup-script which gets
   not installed automatically, because it MUST BE CONFIGURED IN ANY
   CASE! Please don't try to connect to the Internet without setting
   your own IP-addresses. This script is intended to be used with
   the modularised version of the ISDN-subsystem. Refer to the
   Documentation/isdn subdirectory of your kernel-source-tree for
   more information on configuring Lowlevel drivers.

   For the utilities refer to the man pages or look into their
   subdirectories for Documentation.

   For tips, troubleshooting etc. look into the FAQ subdirectory
