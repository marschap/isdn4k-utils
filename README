This is the README file for the "isdn4k-utils" package from "The i4l-crew".

This package contains the following utilities:

  isdnctrl, general linklevel setup utility.
  icnctrl, setup utility for the icn driver.
  telesctrl, setup utility for the teles and HiSax driver.
  pcbitctrl, setup utility for the pcbit driver.
  imon, a tty based utility for monitoring ISDN-activities.
  isdnlog, a set of utilities for connection logging.
  isdnmon, a TclTk based utility for monitoring ISDN-activities.
  
System prerequisites:

  To use this package, you need a kernel with an ISDN-subsystem configured.
  To get a such a kernel, take a clean standard-kernel (> Version 2.0.29 or
  > 2.1.26 resp.) enable the isdn-related features you want and build the
  kernel as usual. If applicable some patches may be needed

  isdn-patches are available at

     ftp.franken.de:/pub/isdn4linux

  For using modularized parts of the ISDN-subsystem, newest modutils
  are strongly recommended.

3. Configuration, Compilation.

   Run "make config"

   This will run various configuration-scripts for each sub-package.
   
   Run "make"

   This builds all utilities except the TclTk-script "isdnmon"

4. Installation

   For the following steps, root permissions are necessary

   a) Create the device-inodes:

     make devices

   b) Install the utilities, the manpages and config-files:

     make install

   The config files usually are installed in /etc/isdn/

5. Application

   The directory ./etc contains an example startup-script which gets
   not installed automatically, because it MUST BE CONFIGURED IN ANY
   CASE! Please don't try to connect to the Internet without setting
   your own IP-addresses. This script is intended to be used with
   the modularized version of the ISDN-subsystem. Refer to the
   Documentation/isdn subdirectory of your kernel-sourcetree for
   more information on configuring Lowlevel drivers.

   For the utilities "isdnctrl", "icnctrl" "telesctrl" and "imon" refer to
   the manpages. For the other contributed utilities, look into their
   subdirectories for Documentation.

   For tips, troubleshooting etc. look into the FAQ subdirectory
