If you checkout this package from the current isdn4linux CVS tree, you need
the last "autoconf" and "automake" (check your next gnu mirror) installed to
complete the package.

Before you compile do the following steps from the main directory:

% aclocal
% autoconf
% automake

This will create all needed files not included with the copy of the CVS
tree.
