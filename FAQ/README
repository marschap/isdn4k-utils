In this directory you find the FAQ for isdn4linux.
It contains answers for those questions that are frequently asked in the
mailing list/news group for isdn4linux (and some more).

The FAQ is available in a German and an English version (the German one being
the most current), as well as in a 7bit and a html version.

"de-i4l-faq" and "eng-i4l-faq" are the source code for all versions of the FAQ.
"bin" contains all perl scripts for generating the FAQ.
In "out" you will find the generated versions of the FAQ.
"doc" has some documentation about the syntax of the FAQ (only interesting if
you want to help working on the FAQ).

"_example" and "_howto" contain postings from the mailing list/news group that
appeared helpful/interesting to me. They may be helpful to you, but be careful:
THEY MAY BE OUTDATED BY NOW!

See the FAQ for more information about the authors of the FAQ.
