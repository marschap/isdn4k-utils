!2General information about isdn4linux

!old
Q: What is isdn4linux?
A: isdn4linux is a set of kernel modules that "teach" the Linux
   kernel ISDN. It consists of a main module ("isdn") and the
   actual hardware drivers that control the specific cards.

!old
Q: What can isdn4linux do?
A: isdn4linux controls ISDN PC cards and can emulate a modem with the
   Hayes command set ("AT" commands). The possibilities range from 
   simply using a terminal program to connections via HDLC (using included
   devices) to full connection to the Internet with PPP to audio applications.

Q: What can't isdn4linux do (yet)?
A: There is no !u1full duplex!u0 audio connection possible.
   Some protocols are still missing (V.110, American
   protocols).

Q: Can I use isdn4linux in North America?
A: See this question the the secion "National Peculiarities".

Q: What do I need for isdn4linux?
A: isdn4linux has been part of the Linux kernel since version 1.3.59.
   In addition, you need the package isdn4k-utils-2.0.tar.gz and possibly
   the HiSax driver.

Q: Is there a mailing list for isdn4linux? 
A: Yes, there is. To subscribe, send an E-mail to 
   "majordomo@hub-wue.franken.de". The subject doesn't matter. The message
   should read  "subscribe isdn4linux <E-mail address>", where <E-mail
   address> is  the address to which mail from the list should be sent.
   Currently  there are about 20-50 messages per day.

!old
Q: How can I have myself removed from the mailing list?
A: To unsubscribe, send another mial to majordomo@hub-wue.franken.de - 
   the subject doesn' matter. The message should read:
   "unsubscribe isdn4linux <E-mail address>", where <E-mail address> 
   is the address to which mail messages from the mailing list had been
   sent.

Q: Is the mailing list mirrored to a newsgroup?
A: Yes, the mailing list can also be accessed at de.alt.comm.isdn4linux -
   a bidirectional gateway makes sure that one can also answer postings.


!old
Q: Is there an archive of the isdn4linux mailing list?
A: Yes, the messages are saved (unsorted) at hub-wue.franken.de.
   They are collected by month. To access the archive, send E-mail to 
   "majordomo@hub-wue.franken.de". The subject doesn't matter. The

!old
Q: Is isdn4linux approved for use by the post office ("postzugelassen")?
A: Germany:!br
     That depends on the driver used. For active cards, the post approval 
     covers the entire card including its firmware. Thus the approval 
     also covers the use of these cards with isdn4linux. The Teles driver 
     is not approved in Germany, even though it works superbly. Therefore, 
     its use is only allowed when connected to the S0 bus of an approved
     PBX.!br
   Other countries:!br 
     We don't have any information... does anyone know more?

!old
Q: What is the most recent version?
A: Currently isdn4k-utils-2.0 is required in addition to the drivers included
   with the kernel. For use with kernel 2.0.0 (and only it), two patches
   (isdn4kernel-2.0-patch1+2) are required. Kernel 2.0.2 is unusable
   because of a bug. Kernels between 2.0.15 and 2.0.24 don't seem to work
   correctly with syncPPP. 2.0.26 contained many i4l bug fixes, but an
   include file (proto.h) was forgotten. A new 'jumbo patch' was included in
   version 2.0.30. Kernels 2.0.27+ are very stable.!br
   There are many changes in kernels 2.1.0 and
   higher; for now they can only be recommended for developers. Together
   with HiSax 1.4, they only work up to 2.1.14. Kernels 2.1.15 and higher 
   require HiSax 2.0 along with a necessary kernel patch.!br
   It's recommended to use i4l versions 2.0 or higher together with a
   2.0.3 or higher kernel (no longer requires any patches!). Kernel
   >2.0.27 is the current standard.

Q: What hardware is u1NOT!u0 supported?
A: For not (with the exception of ICN) no active ISDN cards are supported,
   except the AVM B1, for which there an alpha driver as binary only.  

Q: Does isdn4linux support external terminal adapters?
A: No, but it doesn't need not. Terminal adapaters are designed to behave
   either like a modem or like a netware card. Linux already supports both
   modems and network cards without isdn4linux - so not special ISDN driver
   is necessary (which usually greatly simpligies the configuration),

!old
Q: Which internal cards are supported?
A: Right now there is a driver for all card with a certain 
   Siemens chipset (HiSax driver), that also supports Plug&Play cards.
   See the next question for details.!br
   The HiSax driver has superceded has the old Teles driver, which is therefore is 
   not being further developed. For this reason, the Teles driver has
   many more bugs and should not be used any longer.!br
   Further drivers includes that for the (active) ICN card (ICN driver),
   as well as that for the PCbit card (Octal, Portugal).!br
   There used to for a (special) driver for the itk ix1 micro" from Frank Mohr
   <mohr@fhdacom2.fhrz.fh-darmstadt.de>, but that is not included in HiSax 2.0.
   It supports the following cards:
!verbon
       * ITK ix1 micro V2.0 and V2.1
       * Cisco 200
       * ITK Columbus
!verboff
   Finally there is also a (alpha) driver for the active AVM B1,
   with its own peculiarities. See the question "What about the active AVM B1?".
                                     
!old
Q: What is the new HiSax driver all about?
A: It is a new driver that should support all passive cards that are based on a
   certail Siemens chipset. Currently it supports:
!verbon
        * Teles S0-8
        * Teles S0-16 and S0-16.2
          (identical to: Dr. Neuhaus Niccy 1016, Creatix 16/S0)
        * Teles S0-16.3
        * Teles S0-16.3 PNP
        * Teles PCMCIA
        * Creatix S0 PNP
        * AVM A1 (Fritz!) 
        * ELSA Microlink PCC-16
        * ELSA Microlink PCF
        * ELSA Microlink PCF/pro (only ISDN, not the V34 Modem Chip)
        * ITK ix1-micro Rev.2  
!verboff
   The ELSA PCC-8 should really also be supported, but without the chance
   to debug there remains a bug that prevents this.
   Karsten Keil <keil@temic-ech.spacenet.de> wrote on 14 Oct 1996:
!verbon
     The first goal of the HiSax driver was to add support for more ISDN
     cards to i4l, and this goal remains. Secondly, it should be as simple
     as possible to configure and not appear to work when there is a
     hardware problem (IRQ, reset problems with Teles). I can't fix the
     hardware problems directly, but driver will not load if such problems
     appear. Third (this part has just now begun) is to fully rewrite the
     state machines into a complete DSS1 or 1TR6 that could be approved
     (which doesn't mean that I personally can or want to obtain approval).
     In addition, if possible I'd like to support US ISDN protocols, so
     that i4l can be used outside of Europe. Also, further l2/l3 protocols
     should be added (e.g. V110), leased line support.... a lot of work,
     that I'm sure I cannot do alone. Anyone with any knowledge of
     programming and ISDN (I myself first heard of ISDN in January, and my
     work has nothing to do with ISDN... I learned everything on my own
     time), and anyone who wants to help can contact me.
!verboff
     If you're interested in HiSax, you can find it at
        !link ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/isdn4linux/HiSax/;
     (and hopefully soon at all isdn4linux mirrors!)
   Since HiSax 1.5/2.0 D64 connections are supported. HiSax 2.0 will become
   part of kernel 2.0.30 , and then will no longer need special patches.
   
Q: What about the active AVM B1?
A: Andreas Schultz <aschultz@hppool.cs.Uni-Magdeburg.de> has written a driver,
   that can be found (as an alpha version at:
   !link http://www.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~aschultz/avmb1-1.2-alpha.tar.gz;
   Because he had to sign an NDA, the driver is available only as a binary.

Q: Now that my AVM produces so many interrupts with the HiSax driver,
   which is the best passive card to use with HiSax?
A: Karsten Keil <keil@temic-ech.spacenet.de> wrote on 12. Nov 1996:!br
   It shouldn't make that much difference. As for the load on the system, the 
   Fritz! is probably the worst in the long run [see also the question 
   "My AVM card produces very many interrupts" in HiSax part if the 
   Troubleshooting section], but maybe I can get that right with the timer,
   since that's only noticable when, for example, the system busy with 
   rendering for an entire night.
  Karsten Keil <keil@temic-ech.spacenet.de> wrote further on 2. Dec 1996
   on stability and lack of bugs:
!verbon
        1st choice ELSA
           ELSA (as opposed to AVM) makes the specifications available.
        2nd choice Creatix PNP
           Creatix employees are also not completely negative towards Linux ;-). 
           By the way, this card has been developed by Creatix and
           is not identical to the Teles 16.3 PNP.
!verboff
          
!old
Q: Does isdn4linux support external ISDN adapters?
A: No, isdn4linux supports only internal cards. External  ISDN adapters
   can be accessed either like an analog modem or like a network card, and
   therefore do not need isdn4linux.

!old
Q: Which ISDN modes are supported?
A: 
!verbon
    56k asynchoronous: no
    64k synchronous  : yes
   128k synchronous  : yes (channel bundling - see the next question)
!verboff

Q: Does isdn4linux support channel bundling?
A: The current version of isdn4linux support 2 methods of channel 
   bundling:!br
     - !b1MPPP!b0 (based on sync PPP)!br
     - !b1Raw bundling!b0 (configured by so-called slave channels)!br
   Both variants have their own advantages and disadvantages  See the question "
   How do I use channel bundling?" in the "Channel bundling" section below.!br                                                             
   Warning: Channel bundling saves time, but not any telephone charges.
   Only if you really need the extra bandwidth is it useful.
   
!old
Q: What is the difference between an active and a passive ISDN card?
A: An active ISDN card handles most of the ISDN connection protocols 
   (dialing, accepting calls, etc.) itself. The card includes a kind 
   of mini-computer with its own
   software (firmware). With a passive card, the computer in which
   the card is installed has to perfom these functions.

!old
Q: Are there sites that offer guest access where I can test my 
   isdn4linux setup?
A: Yes, the following sites offer guest access for modem emulation or IP:!br
   - Eberhard Moenkeberg <emoenke@gwdg.de>:
!verbon
     * Welcome to Linux at eberhard.moenkeberg.de (LAN, 192.168.99.1).

       for 192.168.99.1 get accepted. You should come as 192.168.*.*
       because sometimes my "default" route is not your way.
       /ftp is exported for NFS; try "showmount -e".
       You can login as "guest" without password.
       FTP as "gast" with password "gast" avoids the restricted shell.
     * Under ++49-551-7704102, a 28800 bps modem and a Creatix ISDN

Q: Can I combine isdn4linux with diald?
A: Yes, see the "Diald" part of the "Configuration" section.

!old
Q: Can I use isdn4linux as an answering machine?
A: Yes, voice support is possible wih the current version of isdn4linux.
   You can either use "vgetty" from Gert Doerings "mgetty+sendfax", 
   or "vboxgetty" from Michael Herold, which is made especially for
   isdn4linux.
   The latter can be found at:
   !link ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/isdn4linux/contributions/

Q: Can I fax with isdn4linux?
A: Several groups are working on fax software
   that will work together with isdn4linux. At the moment, it looks like
   it will never work... because timing is critical
   for fax software, and Linux doesn't yet have a real time environment. 
   If you do want to fax, you'll have to install an analog fax modem 
   along with your ISDN card.

Q: Is videotex/Btx/Datex-J possible with isdn4linux?  
A: Yes, it works with the modem emulation with the ttyI* devices. There is
   a special register to set for videotex (ATSx=y -  see the Readme's)
   It's also possible to access the Internet via the German T-Online.
   Warning! XCept (formerly Xbtx) has an ISDN configuration option. This
   should NOT be used. XCept should be configured as if a normal modem
   were being used.!br 
   See also the qestions about zu T-Online in the "Configuration" section.

Q: Can I connect to Compuserve with isdn4linux?
A: No, because Compuserve's ISDN dial-in works only with the old V.110 
   protocol. V.110 is not (yet) implemented in isdn4linux. In the meantime, 
   Compuserve offers several X.75 numbers.
   
Q: Which ISDN features can not be offered by isdn4linux?
A: Some ISDN features are device-specifc and can there not be activated by
   isdn4linux for other devices, unless isdn4linux were to falsify the 
   the TEI (which would probably confuse the other device).
   Such device-specific ISDN features are, among others: rejection of a
   waiting call, caller id on/off, hold, conference calls,
   call forwarding, differing COLP/CLRP.

Q: I'd like to write a new hardware driver. Where can I find a description
   of the interfaces to the link level module?
A: In the kernel source (in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/isdn) you can find
   the file INTERFACE - it is the description of the interfaces to the link 
   level module.

Q: How can I access the source from the current development/what is the 
   CVS tree all about?
A: CVS - Concurent Version System!br
   This is a multiuser/server extension to RCS (Revision Control System).
   The I4L drivcers are developed under CVS, and there exists on server
   (oldhades.think.de) a CVS tree to which all developers have access.
   In addition, Fritz has put together an anonymous read-only access. If you
   must have the very newest versions, you can get them there,  however the y
   may contain more bugs than the released versions!!!
   Here is the message from Fritz Elfert <fritz@wuemaus.franken.de>
   about this:!br
   ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING:!br
   I often get patches - against current official releases of course -
   where i have problems applying them. My local source here
   sometimes is 2 or 3 version ahead however i cannot release it, since
   it is incomplete or completely untested etc.!br
   Therefore i now decided to make the CVS repository of the isdn4linux
   public available. Now, programmers who want to have a look at the
   development ongoing or those who always want to get the newest stuff
   here is how to access the CVS repository:!br
   1. Install GNU CVS (any version >= 1.6 will do)!br
   2. create a small shellscript .cvsrsh in your homedir:!br
!verbon
       #!/bin/sh
       exec rsh -l guest $*
!verboff
   3. Set CVS_RSH to this script (eg.: export CVS_RSH=~/.cvsrsh)!br
   4. Set CVS_ROOT to oldhades.think.de:/i4ldev!br
   (eg: export CVS_ROOT=oldhades.think.de:/i4ldev)!br
   5. Execute "cvs -z9 checkout isdn"!br
   -> This will create a directory-tree isdn/ in your current directory.!br
   Below isdn/ you will find the same hierarchy like in the linux
   source plus some scripts to copy/diff the stuff into the linux
   sourcetree.!br
   Similar access is available for the utility-package with the command:!br
!verbon
   cvs -z9 checkout isdn4k-utils
!verboff
   WATCH OUT!!! THE NEWEST STUFF SOMETIMES IS REALLY INSTABLE OR EVEN
   DOES NOT COMPILE WITHOUT PROGRAMMING KNOWLEDGE -
   No newbies questions on this PLEASE! Use the source, Luke!!br
   Note:!br
   Of course the public access is readonly. Access is limited
   to the following cvs commands:!br
!verbon
       checkout
       diff
       export
       status
       update
!verboff
   See the CVS-doc for how to use these commands.!br
   People who want to help _continuously_ developing isdn4linux by writing
   new driver etc. can get a real account for full access. Write me a mail in
   this case.

Q: Is there a working ISDN card for a DEC Alpha with Linux?
A: Thomas Bogendoerfer <tsbogend@alpha.franken.de> wrote on 17 Dec 1996:!br
   I use an ICN ISDN card in my Alpha Noname for

   Ich don't have a passive ISDN card to test HiSax with Linux/Alpha . There
   are problems with the timers (HZ is 1024 on the Alpha). Even the
   icn driver has the "wrong" Timer, which causes a little too much poling of 
   the card (but leads to better ping times:-)). I suspect that this can be
   fixed in time.

Q: Can isdn4linux run in parallel to UISDN?
A: Nils Rennebarth <nils@nus.de> wrote on 10 Dec 1996:
!verbon
        They run parallel. And they run under 2.0.X.
        Both ISDN packages load the module isdn.o, otherwise the naming conventions
        are different. Tip: rename Urlichs isdn.o to uisdn.o ,
        and change lib/modules/modules.isdn (or whatever the file is called
        that lists the modules and is read by the script) accordingly.
        Happily the default names of the ISDN devices are also different.

!b1CLIR (Calling Line Identification Restriction)!b0
!verbon
        CLIR (Calling Line Identification Restriction) can be offered by

        of one's own caller ID to the other party. In Germany, this must be applied 
        for but is without charge (however call by call !i1transmission!i0 of the 
        caller ID costs extra).

!b1COLP (Connected Line Identification Presentation)!b0
!verbon
        COLP can also be offered by the ISDN provier. In Germany, it must be
        applied for, and costs an extra 10.-- DM per month. If you've applied
        for COLP, you get an extended dialing protocal that, for example, can be
        evaluated in the PBX. Current the possibility is being worked on to get 
        around this with the help of a backwards-connected Teles card. One could 
        then get more information than with a running COLP without using any units. 
        That could quickly pay off...

Q: How many ISDN cards can I stuff into my computer?
A: Just as many as there are ISA slots and interrupts/IO addresses.
   The Teles 16.3 can use only 3 different IO addresses, therefore you can
   use at most 3 cards. They each would also need an interrupt.!br
   Peter Strunk <webadmin@mail.bicos.de> gave the following tip on 8 Nov 1996 
   for isntalling a fourth Teles card:
!verbon
        Try out port 0x080h, DIP-SW in the undocumented
        position!
!verboff
   The AVM is similar.!br
   The ICN has no interrupts, a more flexible port configuration
   and the driver places the shared memory area of all ICN cards at the same
   address. The card memory is shown only as needed. !br
   Therefore, one could use
   as many cards are there are slots... one could even increase
   the number of ISA slots with an ISA bus extender.

Q: Does the driver support "dial on demand"?
A: Yes. If a network interface (e.g. "isdn0") is set up, the driver will dial
   the number. If in addition a hang-up timeout (Idle Timeout) has been given,
   isdnctrl huptime <interfaceY> time, then the driver will automatically hang
   up when no data was been transferred over the interface for "time" seconds.
   However, with syncPPP there are problems (see the syncPPP section),

Q: Does isdn4linux support PNP (Plug and Play)?
A: Yes, but only with the HiSax driver. With "Plug" alone
   it's unfortunately not yet ready, more work is necessary:
   (from Karsten Keil <keil@temic-ech.spacenet.de>)
!verbon
        1. HiSax has to be patched into the kernel
           (Attention: use the "-pn" parameter!)
        2. With "make menuconfig" (or "make config") set the following
           kernel options :
             * ISDN = "M" (as module - otherwise PNP doesn't work!)
             * HiSax = "M" (as module - otherwise PNP doesn't work!)
             * 16.3/PNP support
             * EURO support
        3. Compile and install kernel and modules, depmod. (Reboot!)
        4. Read the configuration of the PNP card with:
           "pnpdump > /etc/isapnp.conf".
        5. The configuration file "/etc/isapnp.conf" has to be set by hand.
           Set the following values:
             INT0 - the interupt used by the card
                  (Default for Teles 16.3 PNP: 10)
             IO0, IO1 - the IO ports used by the card
                  (Default for Teles 16.3 PNP: 0x580 and 0x180)
                  (Attention: these values must be 64-bit aligned! Early
                  versions of the PNP cards my suggest incorrect values!)
        6. Activate the configuration with:
           "isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf"
           (must be started at every boot)
        7. Now the HiSax module can be started with:
           "modprobe hisax io=4,<P>,<INT>,<IO0>,<IO1>"
             4     - PNP card
             <P>   - Protocol:
                       2 - for Euro-ISDN (normally)
                       1 - für 1TR6-ISDN (German predacessor to Euro-ISDN)
             <INT> - the value in etc/isapnp.conf for INT0 
             <IO0> - the value in etc/isapnp.conf for IO0 
             <IO1> - the value in etc/isapnp.conf for IO1

Q: Can I use kerneld to load the ISDN modules in the kernel as needed?
A: Emil Stephan <ste@esqhen.su.eunet.de> wrote on 15 October 1996:
!verbon
     By default, kerneld unloads a module after it has not been needed for one
     minute. This is no problem for device drivers ala floppy, etc., but it is
     a problem for drivers that need to keep settings over a longer period 
     of time, e.g. the mixer settings for a sound card or the configuration of
     dial-in and dial-out parameters for ISDN. Unloading the ISDN drivers also
     kills the IP interface ippp0 or isdn0. The entries in the IP layer of the
     kernel then disappear. If you look in the start-up scripts for i4l,
     you'll a lot of things that are configured with isdnctrl, etc.; they
     would have to be reconfigured by ba kerneld each time the module is
     reloaded. The status of the D channel could also be lost. Therefore, my
     recommendation is not to use kerneld, rather load the modules at start-up
     and only unload if necessary for some technical reason.

!3MSN

Q: What is an MSN?
A: Unlike a normal telephone connection, an ISDN connection can have more
   than one telephone number - each of these is called an MSN. MSN is an
   abbreviation for Multiple Subscriber Number.

Q: What is an EAZ?
A: This is a German name for an MSN. In Germany, EAZ and MSN are used
   as synonyms, though in theory one ought to differentiate according
   to the protocol used. That which is called MSN in the Euro-ISDN
   protocol was called EAZ in the German 1TR6-ISDN protocol (a German
   predecessor to Euro-ISDN).

Q: How many MSNs do I need if I want to do the following:
!verbon
	* Telephone
	* Analogue modem (used for data, fax or voice-mailbox)
	* Dialin for X.75 (modem emulation)
	* Dialin for SyncPPP
!verboff
A: One!!!!br
   The two different types of dialin can be recognised using the
   'Service Recognition' code ("digital, data"). If correctly configured,
   the two different types of dialin can also be differentiated (see the
   question "Can I use just !u1one!u0 MSN both for customers that need a
   getty (modem emulation) and also for customers that need a direct network
   connection?" in the section "Dialin").!br
   On the subject of the parallel use of both telephone and analogue modem,
   Gernot Zander <hifi@scorpio.in-berlin.de> had the following tip (Dec. 11
   1996):!br
   Configure fax-getty for 10 rings. If you take the phone and hear a fax
   or modem, you send a USR1 signal (kill -USR1 mgetty-pid) to mgetty, and
   it will take the call.!br
   If your phone socket is correctly wired, the modem will take over the
   connection, cutting off the phone (eg. a TAE NDN socket and the original
   cables. If your modem has a dial-blocker, that may get in the way, unless
   you know the code to switch it off).!br
   [With a suitable modem, mgetty can work as answering machine, and fax
   machine and data modem - Ed.]!br
   Or: if you have an ISDN PABX that allows call forwarding. You can
   even daisy-chain these if you run out of analogue ports.!br
   [Despite this, you will find life simpler if you can give the
   telephone and modem separate MSNs (the ideal solution if you have
   at least 2 MSNs) - Ed.]

Q: What is my MSN?
A: Your telephone company will tell you your MSN. It is your own telephone
   number. The following questions, together with the chapter on national
   peculiarities deal with the finer points of MSNs under isdn4linux.

Q: How do I tell the modem emulation what my MSN is?
A: For the modem emulation you use the command AT&E<msn>, which requires
   the MSN !u1without the area code!u0 (except in the Netherlands).!br

Q: How do I configure my MSN using syncPPP?
A: The MSN for network operation is set up with the command "isdnctrl msn
   <interface>". The MSN is given !u1without the area code!u0 (except in
   the Netherlands).

Q: Where should I configure my own MSN in order to test syncPPP by calling
   myself?
A: If you want to call yourself as a test then you have to configure
   your MSN both as the outgoing and the incoming number.!br
   The configuration of the !i1outgoing!i0 number is done with "isdnctrl
   addphone <interface> out <msn>". You must use the MSN !u1including
   area code!u0 (including the "0" at the start -
   Deutsche Telekom needs this in order to dial correctly). "isdnctrl
   delphone" is used similarly.!br
   The configuration of the !i1incoming!i0 number is done with "isdnctrl
   addphone <interface> in <msn>". The MSN must be entered in the form
   in which it is transmitted to the called party. For Deutsche Telekom,
   this is the MSN !u1including the area code!u0 but !u1without!u0 the
   "0" at the start. "isdnctrl delphone" works similarly.!br
   You may find national differences here (see the chapter "National
   Peculiarities"). See also the following question in case of doubt.

Q: How can I find out how my telephone number is transmitted to the
   calling party?
A: The transmitted MSN can simply be determined, by calling yourself
   (for example by telephone). In the log files you will find the
   entry that looks like: "isdn_tty: call from XXX -> YYY ignored"
   (in order for this to work, you must of course already have the ISDN
   drivers in your kernel and active).

Q: Can I do the following on *THE SAME* MSN:
!verbon
	- Telephony (voice)
	- VBOX (voice, of course)
	- X.75 login (mgetty, /dev/ttyI?)
	- IP interface for IP-connections to other computers?
!verboff
A: Gernot Zander <hifi@scorpio.in-berlin.de> wrote on this subject Dec. 4
   1996: Yes. However, IP dialin cannot be differentiated from X.75 
   dialin, so you are either restricted to dialout, or you must enter
   the MSN of the other party and set secure to on. Then the driver will
   start by asking the net interfaces, and if none match, the call will
   be handed on to the ttyIs. If someone wants to have the choice between
   calling you with X.75 or with IP, they will have to use different
   outgoing MSNs to call you from.

Q: How can I minimise the number of MSNs needed for dialin?
A: See the question in the chapter on dialin.

Q: How do I set the MSN in a Cisco?
A: With "isdn answer1 :<msn>" (or answer2). Eg. "isdn answer1 :12345" will
   set the MSN to 12345.

Q: Why don't I always receive from the German Telekom the number of a 
   caller ("Caller ID")?
A: For data privacy reasons, telephone numbers from the analog network
   are are transmitted unless the caller has explicitly allowed the Telekom 
   to do so (costs nothing) and is connected to a digital switching
   office!br
   Those with an ISDN connection, on the other hand, must explictly deny
   permission for the Telekom to transmit the number, or apply to be able to
   do this on a call-by-call basis [CLIR]. Call-by-call denial is free; 
   call-by-call transmission costs extra. However, it seems to be !u1very!u0
   difficult for the Telekom to configure this correctly on the first try.
   If you depend on the transmission of Caller ID, you should check closely
   that everything is configured correctly.

Q: Do I receive the Caller ID from foreign calls (German Telekom)?
A: Yes, with calls from countries that don't view Caller ID quite as strictly
   as does Germany (e.g. USA, Canada).
   
Q: I've heard that actually two Caller IDs are transmitted?
A: That's right, there's one that is "User-Provided, not screened", and the
   other is "Network-Provided" (from the telephone company).!br

        The first comes from the PBX and is not checked.
        The second is that assigned by the Telekom.
        Here I had calls where a Siemens employee from Munich called
        in with a long Caller ID with a Berlin area code (030).
        I called the Telekom to ask what was going on; they didn't know
        either until they found somewhat competent who told me that
        it's allowed.

!3Teles driver

!old
Q:  I use SETUP.EXE under DOS, to configure my Teles/Creatix with memory 
    xxxxx and IRQ yy. How do I do this under isdn4linux?
A:  You can enter do this by entering the correct kernel options at boot.
    It is not recommended that you compile them into the kernel, however i
    may be neccesary in some cases when software conflicts occure or if you
    have several teles cards in one machine. In this case you should edit
    "/usr/src/linux/drivers/isdn/teles/config.c" to reflect the correct
    settings for your card(s). (read comments in that file)

Q: I'm confused: according to the documentation, my Teles card is configured for 
   IO address 0x180. In Linux (and also in some Windows programs)
   the address is shown as 0xd80?
A: The card uses both IO addresses! Karsten Keil
   <keil@temic-ech.spacenet.de> wrote on 3 Jan 1997:
!verbon
        The addresses actually used are:
          isac 980
          hscx 180/580
          cfg  d80
        The confusion is the result of a misunderstanding. Teles gives the
        HSCX0 address as a reference, while the old Teles driver needs the
        cfg address. Since users were confused by this, both driver can 
        now use either address (which confuses the users even further ;-))

     HiSax checks the hardware and the behavior of the IRQ, so that the

     The -p1 is very important, otherwise all files will end up in new 
     directories under /usr/src/linux.
     Then look at /tmp/HiSax.log for errors/warnings/rejects, if there are

Q: What does the remark: "Known Bugs: incoming calls are only

A: Karsten Keil <keil@temic-ech.spacenet.de> wrote on 14.10.1996:
!verbon
     1. The above statement is not quite correct:
        if ((channel &1)+1 == B-channel )
     2. I descibed the bug the other way around: if B channel 1 is
     being used by another ISDN device and i4l dials out, then the
     logical channel 0 from the VST is assigned B channel 2 ---> OK
     The other ISDN device hangs up.  Another call comes in for i4l,
     this time on B channel 1.  Since channel 0 is taken, and there is
     a fixed order B1->chan 0,2,4...  B2->chan 1,3,5... the call is
     not accepted.  (chan 2,3 is for 2 cards, etc.)  This happens only
     seldomly, and will be fixed soon (if I get a brilliant idea).

Q: How do I switch on Raw IP on the Ascend Max with Radius?
A: "Framed Protocol" must be set to "EURAW". For the authorization via
   Caller Id, the "authentication-type = ascend-clid" must be set.

        It could by, that the Authentication Type works this way, however 
        I use password "Ascend-CLID" to do this.
        An entry in the users file has to look like this:
          69123456 Password="Ascend-CLID"
          User-Name = "Username"
          User-Service = Framed-User
        That means, the Caller ID as username, and "Ascend-CLID" as Password.

Q: I can I use Internet with the German T-Online with i4l?
A: Rainer May <r_may@kahvi.desaster.heide.de> described it as follows:
!verbon
     (the same works of course with a modem. However, the initializing
     sequence looks different.)
     Step 1: Get diald. I don't know where to find it -  ask archie. 
             (diald is used to set a default route to a physically
             non-existant SLIP or CSLIP connection; when packets are set to
             this pseudo-interface, diald establishes the (C)SLIP connection;
             which packets start the connections and when/how the connection
             is terminated can all be configured.) Then install the binary and
             config files (you can use the sample files as they are, but if
             you want e.g. ping to start a connection, you need to make minor
             changes, the timeouts can also be adjusted as needed -  simply
             try it out).
     Step 2: Use a kernel with integrated SLIP/CSLIP or with SLIP/CSLIP
             modules (which has to be loaded, of course).
     Step 3: Isdn4Linux also has to be installed, of course; the important
              part is the modem emulation (ttyIX),
     Step 4: Start diald, e.g. with the following script (I call it
             /etc/rc.d/rc.diald.t-online):
     /usr/sbin/diald /dev/ttyI2 -m aslip local 192.168.90.9 \
     remote 192.168.90.1 defaultroute dynamic modem crtscts \
     lock speed 38400 connect "chat -v -f /etc/diald/t-online" \
     mtu 1500 dslip-mode local-remote
     (This can also be sensibly written in a _single_ line :-)
     Step 5: Write the script, I call it "etc/diald/t-online".
             Looks something like this:
          TIMEOUT 30
          ABORT "NO CARRIER"
          ABORT ERROR
          ABORT "NO DIALTONE"
          ABORT BUSY
          ABORT "NO ANSWER"
          ABORT "NO MSN/EAZ"
          "" ATZ
          OK AT&B2000&E<MyMSN>&X1
          OK ATD01910
          CONNECT .
          "[?25h" <ZugangsKennung>\c
          "[?25h" ""
          "[?25h" ""
          "[?25h" <passwort>
          "[?25h" *53#\c
          "[?25h" *190144100#\c
          "[?25h" 19\c
          "STATUS OK" LIN
          "" "OK"
        Certain place holders need to be replaced, of cource:
       <MyMSN> is the MSN, that you want to explore the world with.
       <Zugangskennung>: The digit monster than usually begins with "000..." 
                         that has been given to you by the Telekom.
       <passwort>:       The password.
     This example script assumes that the defult "Anschlußnummer" and
     "Mitbenutzernummer" are used. If this is not the case, you have to
     adjust the two lines before "[?25h" <passwort> accordingly. For example,
     for the Mitbenutzernummer "0003", the line before "[?25h" <passwort>
     should read:
       "[?25h" 0003\c
     (since the entry field is full after "0003", no CR is entered afterwards)
     When diald is running, an interface "sl0" should suddenly be available
     (ask ifconfig), and the default route should point to it (route -n will
     tell you; without "-n", "route" will try to resolve the fantasy IP
     addresses (which are later replaced with real addresses) -  we don't need
     it do to that). Those who don't work only with numeric addresses, but
     also want to successfully try to "ftp ftp.sunsite.edu", should of course
     enter a name server in /etc/resolv.conf (one from the Telekom has the
     address 94.25.2.129). Then start ftp, telnet, netscape, whatever. That's
     it. By the way, diald will write novels in your syslog. You can read the
     entire login procedure, even if it looks somewhat chaotic. If a request
     doesn't work, use "kill" to stop daild (routes will be automatically
     erased) and check the syslog -  if there is something like Zur Zeit 
     keine verbindung möglich", then the Telekom's gateway is down.  Or
     perhaps the login is incorrect... watch out, after three unsuccessful
     login attempts, the login will be closed and has to be reactivated
     (either per telephone or directly from BTX (e.g. seyon or minicom, dial 
     01910, slowly go through the login screen by hand and follow the
     instructions).

     In the mentioned version of chat, there is a small mistake in logf():

!3Raw IP
Q: What is Raw IP?
A: Raw IP does without the use of a protocol such as  X.75 or HDLC
   (for modem emulation, etc.) or PPP. TCP/IP packets are directly
   exchanged.

Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of Raw IP?
A: Raw IP has both advantages and disadvantages.!br
   Advantages :
!verbon
        * No handshaking 
          => faster connections
        * Authorization by Caller ID
          => fast, safe, no password
        * Fixed IP address
          => a broken connection can be continued by redialing
        * Higher data transfer rates
        * Better stability (smaller driver => almost no bugs)
!verboff
   Disadvantages:
!verbon
        * No handshaking 
          => Configuration must occur !u1beforehand!u0 (IP addresses,...)
          => sensible to use for only for one provider at a time 
        * Authorization only by Caller ID
          => Dial-in only possible from one's own number
        * Fixed IP address
          => must be konwn ahead of time, more IP addresses required,
             no dynamic assignment of adresses possible.
!verboff
  From this summary it should be clear under what conditons it makes sense
  to use raw IP.
  
Q: How can I run a script when a raw IP connection is established?
A: Harald Milz <hm@seneca.muc.de> wrote on 28 Nov 1996:!br

!3Modem emulation (use with ttyI* devices)

Q: Does modem emulation mean that I can toss out my analog modem?
A: No, the name "modem emulation" refers only to the way your own computer
   communicates withe the ISDN driver. It has !u1nothing!u0 to do with the 
   way the data is sent by the ISDN driver over the telephone line - that
   is done digitially! That means that the ISDN driver will !u1not!u0 be 
   able to connect to a non-ISDN BBS!br
   The name is justifies, because any Linux software that can send commands 
   to a modem can also via "modem emulation" send commands to the ISDN driver. 
   And that's what we really want.

!old
Q: Which device should I use for calls out or calls in?
A: Only the ttyI* devices should be used. The cui* devices are created 
   only for reasons of compatibility. Now that there is mgetty, there is not
   reason to use the cui* devices any longer. If they are used, locking will
   not work correctly (several programs could simultaneously attempt to use
   the same device).

!old
Q: How to I switch the modem emulation from X.75 to HDLC?  
A: With the option S14=3; for examplem "ATS13=3".

!old
Q: How can poll with Taylor-UUCP using isdn4linux?
A: As usual, the same as with serial interfaces. Simply use /dec/ttyI* as the
   device, as the init string for the modem emulation you have to set the
   correct MSN or EAZ with "AT&E<msn/eaz>".

!old
Q: What speed should I set for the modem emulation?
A: It doesn't matter. The driver internally always uses the full speed that
   ISDN offers. This is also given in the connect string.

!old
Q: Is 'init-chat "" ATZ OK AT&E4 OK ATS14=3 OK' correct for 1TR6
   (the other side has DSS1)?
A: In principle, yes, when the EAZ is really 4 (at&e4) and HDLC
   should be used (ats14=3).

Q: Was does the register S13 exactly mean?
A: Fritz Elfert <fritz@wuemaus.franken.de> wrote on 1 Dec 1996:!br
   When a user program calls a write to the ttyI device, isdn_tty_write() 
   is called. There the data is copied to a buffer (info->xmit_buf[]), 
   and - if in voice mode - DLE sequences are decoded. Then a counter
   (info->xmit_count) is updated, that updates the size of the buffer.
   Through the timer interrupt, the function isdn_tty_modem_xmit() 
   squenitally calls two further functions: isdn_tty_senddown() and 
   isdn_tty_tint(). The job ofisdn_tty_tint() is to pack the data from 
   the buffer into sk_buffs (the packet buffer also used by networking) and
   also to convert as needed into the various audio formats after a-law
   and, also as needed, to vreat a T.70 header. The resulting packet is put
   into a send queue (info->xmit_queue).isdn_tty_tint() works through
   this queue ab, and passes the packets on to the appropriate low-level
   driver!br
   Now if Bit 1 in Register 13 is set, the call to isdn_tty_senddown() 
   and und isdn_tty_tint() will in addition to the timer interrupt
   call isdn_tty_write(), that is immediately when the write is called by 
   the user program.

!3Async PPP

!commenton
(The following questions are mostly from the syncPPP FAQ by Michael Hipp.)
!commentoff

!old
Q: pppd, ipppd, async PPP, sync PPP - what are they? Which should I use?
A: !b1async PPP!b0 is a character-basedzeichenbasiertes protocol which is
   usually used over analog serial lines geschickt. It is of course possible
   to route async PPP over ISDN (even though ISDN offers a synchronous 
   connection. You can do this by attaching an ISDN modem to your computer. An
   ISDN modem has an RS-232 interface to the computer along with an ISDN
   interface to the telephone company. Assuming that you use PPP on a serial
   interface, then the asynchronous PPP packets are transmitted over the 
   synchronous ISDN line. You can !u1not!u0 use HDLC/syncPPP, otherwise 
   your Linux machine will not accept and process these packets. Instead, 
   you have to edit /etc/inittab:
!verbon
        #
        # inittab       This file describes how the INIT process should set up
        #               the system in a certain run-level.
        [...] 
        # PPPD for asyncPPP over ISDN
        i1:45:respawn:/usr/sbin/pppd -detach silent noipdefault /dev/ttyI0
!verboff
   This tells init that the asynchronous PPP should be started directly from 
   this device. Notice that with the configuration, PPP and only PPP is using
   this line. There are other ways as well; you can start a getty on this
   tty, set up user that starts pppd, etc. If you want to learn more, you 
   can read the FAQ that comes with the standard pppd.!	br
   On the other hand, !b1Sync PPP!b0 is a bit-oriented protocol, for which
   the original pppd cannot be used. Michael Hipp has written an adapted 
   version called ipppd.!br
   ipppd can process PPP packets that arrive as HDLC frames. The PPP 
   driver in isdn4linus sends all IP packets direclty to the network 
   layer, while all PPP protocol frames are send to the /dev/ippp* 
   device. Thus ipppd can be viewed as a simple external network
   protocol program. If you with the help of the /dev/ttyI* devices
   log in to an external computer and from there start PPP, then you
   should use the "old" pppd. If the other side immediately begins the
   send frames, then you've probably reached a sync PPP machine - use the
   network device from isdn4linus with 'syncppp encapsulation' and make
   sure that ippd is running and can contact at least one /dev/ippd*. Make 
   sure you read the directions for isdn4linux on how to configure a
   network device.

!old
Q: I would like to use asynchonous PPP. Can I use the network interface from 
   isdn4linux?
A: No, that's not possible. Asynchronous PPP encapsulation is only possible 
   with the standard PPP package (pppd) through the dev/ttyI* devices möglich 
   (see the previous question). The network interface can only be used by 
   ippd for synchronous PPP encapsulation.

!old
Q: How can I reduce the login time?
A: See the answer for sync PPP, it also applies to asynch PPP.

Q: How can I increase my tranfers rates with PPP?
A: You can add more channels with MPPP (see the appropriate section).
   For everyone for whom that's to expensive and who use !u1async PPP!u0,
   there's a little trick. With the option "asyncmap 0" you can avoid
   escaping all control characters (ASCII<32). If the other side goes 
   along with this, you can increase the transfer rathe by about 12%.


!3Sync PPP

!commenton
(The following questions are mostly from the syncPPP FAQ by Michael Hipp.)
!commentoff

!old
Q: pppd, ipppd, syncPPP, asyncPPP .. what is they? What should I use?
A: See this question in the "Asnyc PPP" section.
   
!old
Q: How do I compile isdn4linux with syncPPP?
A: To compile the kernel with syncPPP included in ISDN4Lilnux, you 
   have to answer the appropriate questions in "make config" with "yes".
   Don't forget to load the module slhc.o before isdn.o, if VJ compression is
   not compiled into the kernel (e.g. if you have no PPP and no CSLIP in the
   kernel. [Note that the use of VJ is problematic and does not work reliably
   - however, the support should still be included in the kernel, since there
   can otherwise be side effects.]

!old
Q: How does use isdn4linux with syncPPP?
A: Synchronous PPP is simply another encapsulation for ISDN4Linux.
   This encapsulation is called "syncppp", therefore for example:
!verbon
     /sbin/isdnctrl encap ippp0 syncppp
!verboff
   Here the name of the interfcae is "ippp0". An interface with this name
   is always used to keep ipppd happy, since it checks the PPP version through
   this device. For now, all devices have to have the name ippp*, where "*" is
   a decimal digit.

Q: How should I name my network interface?
A: The name of the network interface should !u1always!u0 begin with "ippp",
   !u1not!u0 with "syncppp" or "isdn"; othersie the communication with 
   ipppd will not work correctly.

!old
Q: How do I configure a PPP connection with ipppd?
A: You have to start ipppd once after the modules are installed. ipppd
   communicates with the isdn4linux link level devices through /dev/ippp0 to
   /dev/ippp63. A single ipppd can handle all devices at once. If you want two
   PPP connections at the same time, you need to bind ipppd to two devices,
   etc. ipppd has an additional option: "useifip" uses the IP address of the
   connected network interface (if it is not 0.0.0.0). (Even then, ipppd tries
   to use the pointopoint address as the remote IP.) BSD compression hads to
   be turned off - this version cannot use it. [Comment: Van Jacobson
   compression also has to be turned off, in all cases!] 
   In the file etc/rc.isdn.syncppp in the isdn4kernel-util package,
   you can find an example configuration.

Q: How do I get ipppd to open a PPP connection?
A: With the command "isdnctrl dial <interface>".

Q: How can I tell if a connection is unsuccessful (busy)?
A: Andreas Berg <berg@studm.hrz.uni-siegen.de> wrote on 24 Nov 1996:!br
   I simply wait a couple of seconds, then check whether the default route 
   exists, if so, then the connection is there as well.

Q: Where can I find the latest version of ipppd?
A: It is on Michael Hipp's home page:!br
     !link http://www.sfs.nphil.uni-tuebingen.de/~hipp/isdn/linux/;

!old
Q: How can I use more than one ippp* device?
A: All ippp* devices in use must be configured separaley with 
   "isdnctrl addif" etc. Each ippp* device should be assignd to
   its own IP address (routing!).!br
   Several ippp* devices can be assinged to a single MSN.
   Several callers can then simultaneously use this  MSN. 

!old
Q: I want to talk to remote machines which needs different configurations. The 
   only way I found to do this is to kill the ipppd and start a new one with 
   another config to connect to the second machine.    
A: You must bind a network interface explicitly to an ippp device, where you 
   can connect a (for this interface) individually configured ipppd. With the 
   (unfortunately poorly documented) command!br
   "isdnctrl pppbind <interface> <Number>"!br
   you can link the interface <interface> to the device ippp<Nummer>. You can 
   release the link with "pppunbind". 
   

Q: How does the (little-documented) "pppbind" command in isdnctrl work?
A: You have to first know how ipppd gets its data. All data that come in
   over the ISDN line is received by the network devices (these are 
   set up with isdnctrl). Then the data given to one of the /dev/ippd*
   devices - to one where a ipppd daemon is waiting for data.!br
   To the network interfaces, all ipppd's appear to be able to handle the
   just-received data - therefore it is normally impossible to predict
   which ipppd will receive data from which network interface.!br
   In practice, you usually install several ipppd's with differing 
   configurations. Each of these should receive data !u1exclusively!u0 
   from a certain network interface (that has also be specially configured).
   The "pppdbind" command serves just this purpose. With:
!verbon
        "isdnctrl pppbind <interface> <number>"
!verboff
   attaches the interface <interface> to the device /dev/ippp<number>.!br
   Example: To attach the interface "ippp5" to /dev/ippp2, the following
   configuration should be used:
!verbon
        "isdnctrl pppbind ippp5 2"
!verboff
   Similary, with the command dem "pppunbind" will undo this attachment.!br

!old
Q: I want to use dynamic IP address assignment. How must I configure the 
   network device?
A: At least you must have a route, which forwards a packet to the ippp 
   network interface to trigger dialing. A default route to the ippp interface 
   will work. Now you must choose a dummy IP address for your interface. If for
   some reason you can't set the default route to the ippp interface, you may 
   take any address of the subnet from which you expect your dynamic IP number 
   and set a 'network route' for this subnet to the ippp interface. To allow 
   overriding of the dummy address you must call the ipppd with the 
   'ipcp-accept-local' option. You must know how the ipppd gets the addresses 
   it has to configure. If you don't give any option, the ipppd tries to
   negotiate the local host address!  With the option 'noipdefault' it 
   requests an address from the remote machine. With 'useifip' it gets the 
   addresses from the net interface. You also can set the addresses in the 
   option line with the <a.b.c.d:e.f.g.h> option. Note: the IP address of the 
   remote machine must be configured locally, or the remote machine must send 
   it in an IPCP request. If your side doesn't know the IP address after 
   negotiation, it closes the connection! You must allow overriding of 
   addresses with the 'ipcp-accept-*' options, if you have set your own or the 
   remote address explicitly. Try these options, e.g:
!verbon
    /sbin/ipppd :$REMOTE noipdefault /dev/ippp0
!verboff
   where REMOTE must be the address of the remote machine (the machine giving 
   your address to you) 
   
Q: Accrding to the manpage, ipppd offers the option "dns-addr". But my ipppd 
   refuses to take this option!
A: Andreas Kool <akool@Kool.f.EUnet.de> wrote on 31 Dec 1996:!br
   In the Makefile for ipppd you have to activate the option "USE_MS_DNS"!

   ipppd 2.2.6g (ftp.gwdg.de pub/linux/isdn/ippp/). Then in the Makefile
   comment out 'IPX_CHANGE = 1' ...!br
   But that's not yet enough. When calling ipppd, you have to add "+ipx",
   otherwise IPX (in ipppd) will not be activated. Of course, you also
   have to the the "correct" IPX options... I don't know what they are
   for each individual case. I've never done IPX. ;) If you then get 
   several IPXCP debug messages in the log and nothing works, I'd be 
   interested in this log (unless you can analyze the problem yourself).
   Success stories are also welcom, of course (but with untested software,
   this is highly improbably) ;)

!old
Q: How can I reduce login delay?
A: You can write out a login session with ("Debug-Log"), and see which
   options the other computer is refusing. Next time, configure ipppd
   without these unused options. A further side effect is that such
   unused options increase the redundance (e.g. when the other computer
   has bugs and refuses the options incorrectly). To create a log file, 
   see "How to I create a log for ipppd".!br
   Another tip came from G.Richter <richter@ecos.de> on 12 Dec 1996:!br
   The negotiation phase with a CISCO, as well as with an AVM MPR, was
   drastically accelerated by the option 
!verbon
        lcp-restart 1
!verboff
   The ipppd seems to send the first LCP packet before it can reach the
   other side, and then waits 3 seconds before trying again, but with this
   option it waits only 1 second. For me the time to establish the connection
   sank from 5 to 2 seconds.
   
Q: How can I increase my PPP data transfer rates?
A: You can establish more channels with MPPP (see the MPPP section).
   For everyone for whom this is too expensive, and who use !u1asyncPPP!u0
   there is another little trick. With the option "asyncmap 0", you can
   chose to not "escape" control characters (ASCII<32) (the default is to
   escape these characters). If the other side goes along, the transfer 
   rate will be about 12% faster.


!3ISDN4Linux in a network


Q: I've successfully used the Internet with my Linux system using isdn4linux. 
   Now I'd like to have another computer on my Ethernet profit from the 
   Internet as well. But how?
A: Thomas Pfeiffer <pfeiffer@pds.de> wrote on 5 Nov 1996:!br
   There are several choices, depending on what all you would like to
   do on the Internet from your LAN. Basically, there are 3 possibilities:
!verbon
        1. Your LAN is an official Class C net with IP addresses valid on 
           the Internet.
             This case is the easiest of configure. You give each network
             card on your network one of these addresses and set a 
             default route on the ISDN card that goes to your    
             provider.
        2. You'd only like to do http in Internet from your LAN.
             In this case you can make up IP addresses for your LAN;
             the only official IP address is that for your ISDN card.
             Then install a proxy server on your Linux router, and
             enter it in all of your browsers. In this case you do
             not need a default route.
        3. From your LAN you only want to log in to your Linux ISDn
           router and FROM THERE do your work on the Internet.
             THis is even simpler, then you don't even need a proxy 
             server.

!verbon
        There is a fourth possibility I'd like to add, although I've
        never tried it out (since I prefer the 1st choice and have a
        a Class C Subnet, hehe ;), but I have a friend who after
        some playing with the Linux kernel has actually gotten IP
        masqerading to work.!br
        It works somewhat like a proxy (when looking at the effect of 
        hiding the IP). It doesn't offer any caching, of course, but 
        masks to the outside all internal IPs with that of the ISDN
        interface. Don't ask me how the routing functions, but it 
        works...!br
        If I'm not completely mistaken, my friend does this with a
        dynamically assigned IP ?!

Q: I have a local area network, (LAN) with computers based on several
   platforms - Win95, Win311, NT, Amiga (AmiTCP) and MacIntosh (MacTCP) - all
   connected to the outside world through a Linux router. The Linux machine has
   an ISDN card. My ISP provides me with a dynamic IP-address each time I log
   in. I want all the computers to reach the INTERNET not just the Linux box.
   How can I do this?

A: Most work has to be done on the Linux box. First you need a kernel with
   IP-forwarding and masquarding enable. You can get on by answering the 
   following questions when doing "make config" with YES.
!verbon
     Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers  Y

     PPP (point-to-point) support (if you  PPP to the  ISP) Y
     SLIP (serial line) support                             Y
     Ethernet (10 or 100Mbit) (or Arcnet or ...)            Y
     ISDN support [1]                                       M
     Support synchronous PPP (if you're using ipppd)        Y
     HiSax SiemensChipSet driver support                    M
       (Then select the HiSax support)
     (You can also choose to make a kernel with build in ISDN support
     instead of modules)
!verboff

   Then do a "make dep", "make zImage", "make modules" and "make 
   modules_install" to build the kernel. The installation of ISDN and PPP is 
   explained somewhere else in this FAQ. We now continue with the following 
   assumptions:!br
   * The ISDN system is operational; you can build a connection to your ISP.!br
   * The LAN is operational (i.e. ethernet or Arcnet or) and IP addresses
     have been assigned (i.e. 192.168.xx.xx). The Linux box can be reached by 
     the other computers (i.e. by ping).!br
   Now we need to accomplish two things:!br
   * A computer in the LAN with a "non-local" IP address will request the
     Linux router to establish a connection to the provider!br
   * The Linux router itself will connect the computers in the LAN to the
     provider. It will also "hide" the computers in the LAN from the ISP, and
     all the IP packets will appear to come from or go to the router. While in
     fact the are coming from the computers in the LAN.!br
   !br
   We'll start with the second one: This hiding doesn't mean we're trying
   to cheat our provider. (Allthough it is possible to provide "clients" with 
   a cheap connection to the internet). It is required technically. Only the
   IP address of the Linux-box is known to the provider. So the Linux-box must
   "mask" all the packet with it's own IP address and keep track of which
   computer in the LAN sent which packet so the it can return the
   incoming packets to the correct computer in the LAN. Luckily this
   function is built in kernels>=2.0.0 and is called "IP-Masquarading". Here's 
   how it works:!br 
   !br
   A computer on the LAN sends a packet that contains (next to the IP-address 
   and target port of the receiver) it's own sender-address (in IP form) and 
   an answering port. The masquerading Linux router will replace this address
   with it's own and the answering port with a free one. Under this free port
   the sender address is stored. Now when a packet comes in from the internet
   the receiver address and  port gets overwritten with the return address and
   port and the packet is send to the correct computer in the LAN. Packet for
   packet. This only works if the application sends along a return address,
   telnet, http, (irc, tcp differently) all do this (ping doesn't work).!br
   !br
   To get TCP and IRC to work while masquerading 2 modules need to be loaded:
!verbon
     /sbin/modprobe ip_masq_ftp
     /sbin/modprobe ip_masq_irc
!verboff
   Then the forwarding rules in the kernel add forced to masquerade:
!verbon
     /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a m -P all -S 192.168.123.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0 -b
!verboff
   The ipfwadm program is available via anonymous FTP at!br
     !link ftp://ftp.xos.nl/pub/linux/ipfwadm/ipfwadm-2.3.0.tar.gz;!br
   In this example the LAN addresses 192.168.123.0 to 192.168.123.254 are
   used. To keep things simple we make the Linux router 192.168.123.1!br
   The above line masquarades all the packets coming from 192.168.123.x to
   the outside world. This has a disadvantage: all the packets inside the
   LAN also get masqueraded. You can prevent this by adding more rules
   (man ipfwadm is recommended reading if you want to do this).!br
   !br
   Hint from Ralf Rudolph <ralf@artifex.de>:
!verbon
    The way I see it, that doesn't matter, the computers in the LAN will
    continue to communicate over the fake IP addresses. You can test this by
    turning off your Linux box (shutdown). Nothing will happen. This is because
    masquarading is a forwarding rule in the firewall and will only be used 
    when forwarding (literally "passing on"). On the LAN nothing is forwarded 
    so nothing is masqueraded, unless you have multiple Ethernet cards in one
    computer then you need to enter some extra firewall rules.
!verboff
    Answer: This is actually not entirely true; although it does no harm. We
    have accomplished "hidding" the LAN from the provider. We now want the
    Linux box to automatically connect to the outside world whenever a computer
    in the LAN requests it. All the computers within must address their
    packets for the outside world to the Linux box, which will take it from
    there. This is very easy. Most TCP protocols (for Windows, Mac) all have 
    the option of specifying a "default gateway" or "gateway". You must specify
    the local address of the router. You cannot enter the IP address which you
    receive when you connect to your provider because you don't know which 
    address your going to get, and also it's different everytime you log in.!br
    The last step is getting the ISDN system to do "Dial on Demand". This is
    can be done in two ways.!br
  * Use synchronous PPP, in other words "ipppd". The only thing you have to do
    is to make sure that the default route point to the device (ippp*) you 
    made with isdnctrl. Warning: the kernel remove this route when the
    connection is broken. You have to re-establish the defaultroute after the
    line goes down. You can do this (for example) in the file /etc/ppp/ip-down.
    The risk of this methode is that applications running on the LAN will make
    the Linux box build a connection for each resolve-request, keep-alive
    packet or ARP broadcast they send (your phone company will be very 
    grateful).!br
    It can happen that requests by the LAN can take a long time. I don't know
    whether the kernel or ipppd can't handle the first outgoing packets, but
    it's always a good idea to push the red button in Netscape for example and
    then reload the first page you're accessing right after starting up
    Netscape.!br
    The configuration of ipppd is explained in detail elsewhere:!br
       !link http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~ui161ab/www/isdn/;!br
    * Use a-synchronous PPP or SLIP/CSLIP for your connection. For this you
    can use a programme called "diald" [4]. This has several advantages, it's
    highly configurable; you can for instance specify that there are to be no
    connections made between 9 and 12 a.m. or that name server request don't
    trigger the ISDN device. For those of you that don't want to bother with a
    lot of configuration options that's fine; the default-configuration can be
    used without danger for life or money (hard to translate, German
    expression).!br    
    Now,!br 
    if the masquerading rules are set,!br
    if the PC in the LAN all know that the Linux box is the gateway,!br
    if "ping abc.edu" typed in on the Linux console builds up a connection
    to the Internet provider!br
    !u1then!u0 also all other machines in the LAN should be able to access the
    Internet.

Q: How can I allow the users in my local network to use the ISDN card(s)
   im my Linux PC?

   Um ... "modemd" on the Linux side, along with appropriate software

Q: Where can I find "modemd", and for which platforms are there "clients"?
A: Rainer May <r_may@khavi.desaster.heide.de> wrote on 10 Dec 1996:!br
   In theory (and in practice too) this can be done by any comfortable
   telnet client. There should be some uucicos for this as well (under 
   DOS fxuucico together with fxwtcp, for example).!br
   If you generally want to offer all appliations a kind of "remote
   COM port", then there is COMT for Windows (95), "telser.device" for
   Amigas. There is supposed to be something like this for the Mac as
   well (it's system architecture is very inviting for this), but I
   don't know any names.!br
   modemd (which is really just a one-liner in PERL, if I remember
   correctly) works here with COMt and telser.sevice with no problems.
   
Q: Where can I find COMt?
A: Oliver Hahn <oliver@bbtt.de> wrote on 15 Dec 1996:!br
   Try a Simtel mirror (e.g. ftp.funet.fi) in the directory
   pub/simtelnet/win3/inet. The thing is called comt200.zip.

        exec "cu","-E","''", "-l", "$ARGV[0]";
       die "$0: Cannot exec cu: $!\n";

   And then it has to be started in inetd:
!verbon

        isdn            20007/tcp       modemd  # ISDN  service via TCP
!verboff
   Disadvantage: comt-2.0 is only "visible" to 16-bit applications. The
   use under win95 and Windows NT therefore is restricted to 16-bit 
   stuff.

Q: Why doesn't isdnlog record the number dialed by my other ISDN devices,
    since it records the charges?

A: Because the ISDN card, like all ISDN device, has separate lines for
   sending and receieving (RX and TX lines). Isdnlog has to read data
   from the receiving line to learn the number dialed. This isn't possible,
   at least for the Teles cards, as Karsten Keil <keil@temic-ech.spacenet.de> 
   wrote on 12 Feb 1997:
!verbon
       This is the case for all cards with 1 Siemans ISAX; it has (and needs)
       only 1 sender and 1 receiver.
       Theoretically, it's possible to read the entire D channel with just one
       receiver (even with the ISAC); the D bits from the RX line are copied 
       (somewhat delayed) to the TX line, over which the access control 
       (collision recognition) of the SO bus takes place.
       Unfortunately with the ISAC it's not possible to read the echo bits 
       in TA mode from a register.
!verboff
   See the next questions for a possible solution.

Q: How can I get isdnlog to also show the telephone numbers for other
   isdn devices?

A: Es gibt zwei Möglichkeiten. Zum einen gibt es von der Deutschen Telekom die
   kostenpflichtige Möglichkeit, alle Daten nochmal zurückschicken zu lassen
   (COLP = Connected Line Identification Presentation, ca. DM 10,- pro Monat
   je Basisanschluß). Diese kann isdnlog (>=2.52) dann wieder auf der TX
   Leitung lesen.!br
   Alternativ dazu wird isdnlog ab der nächsten Version (aktuell ist 2.52)
   die Möglichkeit bieten, mit einer zweiten, "verpolten" Teles-Karte zu
   arbeiten, bei der die RX Leitung an den TX Anschluß der Karte geführt wird.
   Die RX Leitung der Karte darf an keine der Leitungen angeschlossen werden!
   Aufgrund der Schaltung kann die Teles-Karte für keinen anderen Zweck mehr
   eingesetzt werden. Das ganze sieht dann so aus:
!verbon
 B  3 -- RX+ 2a ---------------\
 U  4 -- TX+ 1a -- offen        ------------
 S  5 -- TX- 1b -- offen        ------------  Karte
    6 -- RX- 2b ---------------/ 
!verboff
   Eine theoretische dritte Möglichkeit gibt es noch für alle, die eine
   eigene TK-Anlage haben, über die sämtliche weiteren Geräte angeschlossen
   sind. Falls diese Telefonanlage ebenfalls alle ausgehenden Telefonnummern
   protokollieren kann, könnten diese ausgelesen werden (üblicherweise über
   eine serielle Schnittstelle).!br
   Es gibt jedoch einen Grund, warum isdnlog das nicht schon längst
   unterstützt. Um die Daten zu verwerten, müßte isdnlog diese sofort beim
   RELEASE COMPLETE zur Verfügung gestellt bekommen, bevor auf dem D-Kanal
   neue Informationen übermittelt werden. Leider sind die bisher getesteten
   Telefonanlagen dafür zu langsam (insbesondere die weit verbreitete ISTEC). 
   Als einzige Möglichkeit bleibt, die Daten nachträglich zu kombinieren.
   Dabei kommt es aber zur Schwierigkeit, die unterschiedlichen Uhrzeiten
   zu synchronisieren. Wer das realisieren möchte, ist dazu herzlich gerne
   eingeladen (ich stelle auch gerne entsprechende Logs von meiner Ackermann
   Euracom zur Verfügung - Matthias Heßler <hessler@wi-inf.uni-essen.de>).

Q: Erfaßt isdnlog auch die neuen Tarife der deutschen Telekom (City Weekend,
   City Plus)?
A: Da die Vermittlungsstellen der Telekom das nicht hinbekommen, werden die
   Gebühreninformationen nicht korrekt übermittelt. Die nächste Version von
   isdnlog (>2.52) wird das jedoch können.

Q: Wie kann ich isdnlog dazu bringen, die Gebühren nach den Regeln der
   niederländischen Telefongesellschaft zu berechnen?
A: Dazu muß nur im Makefile von isdnlog "COPTS=-DISDN_NL" gesetzt und isdnlog
   neu kompiliert werden.

Q: Wie kann ich isdnlog dazu bringen, die Gebühren nach den Regeln der
   schweizer Telefongesellschaft zu berechnen?
A: Dazu muß nur im Makefile von isdnlog "COPTS=-DISDN_CH" gesetzt und isdnlog

Q: Wie kann ich mir den Datendurchsatz grafisch anzeigen lassen?
A: Dazu gibt's "xisdnload". Clemens Perz <listperz@gwsnet.ttt.de> wußte am
   6. Feb 1997 noch eine weitere Möglichkeit:!br

Q: What do the different states of isdnbutton mean (green, yellow, red)?
A: Markus Gutschke <gutschk@uni-muenster.de> wrote on  21 Dec 1996:!br
   "isdnbutton" checks the following conditions:
!verbon
        GREEN - at least one ISDN connection is active. Unfortunately 
                I'm unable to check how the connection was activated.
                It doesn't have to be a network connection, and can 
                also be an incoming connection (at least for me, it would
                be useful to distinguish these).
        YELLOW- no active ISDN connection was found, but at least one
                ISDN interface has an outgoing telephone number for
                deman dialing. There is therefore the "danger" that
                a connection will occur automatically.
                werden kann.
        RED   - Neither of the above is true. This usually means that
                a) the kernel doesn't recognize ISDN, or the ISDN
                   subsystem is not active, or
                b) the outgoing ISDN connections are deactivated.

Q: How can I convert audio messages which where recorded by vbox to other
   formats (i.e. from uLaw to WAV)?
A: The standard tool for converting all sound formats is SOX. SOX is
   available as source-code for both UNIX and DOS. You can get it at:!br
   !link http://www.powerweb.de/mpeg/util/msdos/sox10c.zip;!br 
   (including sources that compile under Linux).

Q: How can I format WAV for ulaw (for my vbox announcement message)?
A: We receive the following tip form Christian Stueble 
   <stueble@ls6.informatik.uni-dortmund.de> on 15 Jan 1997:!br
   For me, the following (somewhat indirect) method works:   
!verbon
       sox <file>.wav -r 8000 <file>.ul rate
       rmdcatheader -u <file.ul> > <file>.msg
       cat <file>.ul >> <file>.msg
!verboff
   It could be that you have to give different parameters to sox.
   As a first test you can try <file>.msg > /dev/audio, you should
   be able to hear something.

     I use chargeint, it works great; for me charge units come during the

     isdn4k-utils-2.0; then compile isdn with the -Dchargeint flag (see
     Makefile). The kernel and isdnctrl of course also have to be recompiled.
     Then start isdnlog with the -hx option, where x is the number of seconds
     left until the next charge unit. Then chargeint will hang up. In the
     start script for isdn, define a huptimeout as usual to activiate the

     The chargeint always hangs up two seconds before the end of the charge

     date. An additional parameter for "-h" will reduce this length of time by
     the given value. This additional paramet should not be used wotj

     In this example is can be much short; I use 5 seconds. Then I can use the

Q: With which drivers can I use the chargeint patch?
A: You can use the Teles or the HiSax driver. Of course, isdnlog must
   be running correctly (isdnlog 2.50 has to be patched to 2.51
   to run with the HiSax driver).

Q: When does it not make sense to use the chargeint patch?
A: There are problems when the IP is assigned dynamically. Then a broken
   connection cannot simply be restarted (since the IP address has changed).
   The interrupted FTP, telnet or WWW connection must then be newly
   established.

!old
Q: How does the chargeint patch work?
A: With the isdnctrl parameter "chargeset" you can set the length of a charge
   unit, so that it can hang up at the correct time. However, since the length
   of a charge unit depends on the time of day, day of week, holiday, etc., it
   makes no sense to use a set value. Here's where isdnlog comes in. It
   notices when a connection is established and calculates the length of a
   charge unit depending on the time of day, day of week, holiday. This is
   then given to isdnctrl, so it can hang up at the right time. isdnlog
   "tunes" isdnctrl at each connection, and also during a connection (when
   isdnlog is run with the "-w x" parameter). isdnlog allows isdnctrl exactly
   2 seconds before the next charge unit to hang up, as long as the time
   entered with "huptimeout" has elapsed with no data being transferred. The
   transmission of a charge unit impulse is not necessary, since the times are
   calculated closely enough. The charge unit impulse is sent a varying
   intervals, so it cannot be relied upon

  Default URL: !link http://www.provi.de/~gvz/chargeint.html;

Q: How can I be sure that the chargeint patch is using the correct time?
A: It's best to synchronize the clock in your own computer with that of
   the switching station with "isdnlog -t2". For setting the clock, see the
   "Miscellaneous" section, the question: "How can I set the clock of my 
   computer with ISDN?"


!3Dial-In

Q: How can I enable others to login via ISDN?
A: The same way as via a normal serial port. Start a getty (mgetty from Gert
   Doering is highly recommended) on one of the ISDN devices with modem 
   emulation (/dev/ttyI*). The entry in /etc/inittab looks like this:
!verbon
     #
     # ISDN Lines
     #
     I0:56:respawn:/usr/local/sbin/mgetty ttyI0
     I1:56:respawn:/usr/local/sbin/mgetty ttyI1
!verboff
   Then the init string needs to be entered in the mgetty.config, since
   mgetty needs to know which MSN or EAZ to "listen" to. Here is an example
   for /dev/ttyI0
!verbon
     port ttyI0
     modem-type data
     speed 38400
     init-chat "" ATZ OK AT&E0 OK AT&B512 OK
!verboff
   The example sets the EAZ (with 1TR6-ISDN) to 0. For Euro ISDN, the MSN
   (without area code) would be given instead of the 0 in "AT&E0". 
   For X.75 the block size is set to 512 bytes.
   Alternatively you can enter the entire configuration onto a single line
   in /etc/initab (here printed on two lines!):
!verbon
     i0:45:respawn:/sbin/mgetty -D -m '"" ATZ OK AT&E0 OK AT&B512 OK'
       -s 38400 ttyI0
!verboff
   The most elegant way is to use iprofd. This daemon takes advantage of
   the AT&W0 command in the i4l modem emulation. You start iprofd
   with a path as parameter, e.g. "iprofd /etc/i4lprofile"
   Then with minicom or another terminal program, open an ISDN tty
   device and enter the necessary AT commander by hand. 
   When finished, enter the command AT&W0, then the kernel notifies iprofd 
   to write the current configuration to the file. From now it it is enough
   to start iprofd in you isdn init script, and to initialize the appropriate
   ISDN tty devices with ATZ


!old
Q: Someone would like to dial in to my mgetty with HDLC. Is ttyI1 correct,
   or do I have to start with ttyI0?  
A: No, it doesn't matter. It also has nothing to do with the number of the
   B channel (0 or 1). You just have to activate HDLC in the init string 
   (ATS14=3).

!old
Q: Is it possible with mgetty to automatically start pppd when LCP frames
   are received?
A: Yes, it is. You have to compile mgetty with "-DAUTO_PPP" and then
   in the file /usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax/login.config, the line  
!verbon
#/AutoPPP/ -    ppp     /usr/sbin/pppd auth -chap +pap login kdebug 7 debug

Q: How can I have (i)pppd check passwords from /etc/passwd instead of
   /etc/ppp/pap-secrets when someone dials in?
A: G. Richter <richter@ecos.de> wrote on 17 Dec 1996:!br

Q: Wie erreiche ich, daß sich mehrere Personen gleichzeitig bei mir einwählen
   können?
A: Es müssen genausoviele gettys bzw. Netzinterfaces konfiguriert werden, wie
   sich Personen gleichzeitig einwählen können. Diese gettys bzw.
   Netzinterfaces können auch auf die gleiche MSN eingestellt werden, dann
   können mehrere Personen auf derselben MSN einwählen (solange B-Kanäle

   Ja. Zum einen reicht die MSN des _Kunden_, wenn die Netz-Interfaces auf

   ppp-Versuche zu erkennen und direkt (i)pppd loszufeuern, wobei ich jetzt

   Sonst kannst du noch versuchen, isdn4linux die HLC's beizubiegen, mußt dann
   aber die Kunden überzeugen, die auch richtig einzustellen. Aber erstens
   wird reichen, solange du keine Leute hast, die mit einer MSN mal das eine

     A Banzai! might also help. As hardware any PC with (e.g.) Teles

     personally don't like Banzai! routers at all because of their
     poor diagnostic capabilities, in particular remote maintenance as
     pretty much impossible (unless you have the SNMP capable version,
     but it costs somewhat more). But when they run, they run stable
     and as opposed to Ciscos they are capalbe of real callback.  From
     Cisco as an alternative there is the Cisco 2503 for about 5000
     DM, that has only one Port, but two serial interfaces, on which
     you can connect a TA (each about 800 DM).  Finally, last, not
     least you can bit the bullet and get several Cisco 1003s
     (ca. 2000DM each). In case the price does not play such a bit
     role, I would take this variation. I simply like Ciscos. :-)

     You need to decide, which is more important to you:
       (1) saving money
       (2) saving time
     For (1) there are two solutions:
     - Banzai! (now called Flux or Concorde..)   
       -> !link http://www.concorde.de/; (from cls, www.cls.de)
       -> !link http://www.flux.de/;  (from INS, www.ins.de).  
       Based on at least a 386 and routes Ethernet -> ISDN, works with
       many cards, the programmers themselves work with Teles.
       Disadvantates: not cleanly remotely configurable, unless you
       buy the SNMP option, which makes it more expensive and
       therefore more unattractive...
     - ISPA + PCROUTE   
       -> !link http://www.biochem.mpg.de/~heha/;   
       also requires a PC (also works with 286). Has much 
       fewer options than Banzei, Flux, Concorde etc., and is not at all 
       remotely configurable, but runs totally stable. 
       PCROUTE costs nothing, ISPA now costs 70.-, perhaps you can still find 
       version 2.41 that runs unlimited even without a key.
     Both solutions support pretty much all ISDN protokols (including
     the diverse HDLC variantions etc..). Support for SPVs (soon
     obsolete) and D64S is there at least for Teles cards (depends on
     the CAPI, not the software). You can get old PCs for <1.000 DM,
     the Teles card also doesn't cost much but die Flux, Concorde
     software is expensive if you get SNMP as well -> you are then at
     2.000.- and you could just as well buy a cisco1003...  (2) IF you
     don't want to assemble anything yourself, you can take with 4
     individual Cisco1003 routers, at around 2300.- and all of your
     problems are more or les solved (other than the diverse IOS
     bugs...). But CISCO router can't do "correct" callback... and as
     protocol only PPP (although there are IOS versions, that don't do
     it cleanly) und CISCO-HDLC.  If you need 4 BRIs -> CISCO 4000,
     but then you should get the 8 BRIs, costs just under 2.000 DM
     less. But then you have to invest somewhat more than
     10.000.-...:-( Another varition: ELSA LANCOM MPR, also costs <
     2.000 DM, can do callback, various protocols (HDLC, X.75, PPP)
     and is really nice to configure.  At the Interop, a Shiva ISDN
     Router with a/b switch for 1600 DM was exhibited, but with 4 BRI
     ports bei you'd be somewhat over 6000 DM...  Then there are
     several manufacturers that offer simple BRI routers (prices
     tending to fall well under 2.000), e.g. ASCEND, MIRO etc...  But
     if you must have 4 BRIs, there's only the choice between Cisco
     and Ascend..  uh... and since you asked about Ascend, I have a
     price list here from Ascend (july 96), the max400 WITHOUT BRI
     port already costs 15.750.-, the 4-way BRI is then an additional
     11.250 DM... I think that's enough about Ascend...:-(
     In case you have nothing against a PC solution, you could also
     use netGW from netcs (!link http://www.netcs.com;). This ia a software
     for SCO, AIX, Sun etc. and is based on PCs e.g. the cards from
     Diehl ISDN. netGW should offer by far the most protocols and
     options, but then you have to become familiar with a PC the
     problems that come along with it.  A SCO solution with 4- ISDN
     cards + Software costs also around 10.000 DM, however.  We have
     now retirned almost all of our Banzai! and Co, since in the long
     run they are only poorly remotely aministerable are are nowhere
     near as stable as Cisco or other stand-alone routers...  In the
     end, it is a decsion of you would rather spend more money, and it
     runs right awwy, or you build your own PC router and have to play
     to get it going.  You have to decide for yourself, although Teles
     can drive you to desparation since the CAPI versions often have
     huge problems as as normal user can't get any older
     versions. Support at Teles is not that great (toll 0190-8 phone
     number), and you can easily spend 20-30 DM on support call
     without getting an solution to your problem...

        For dialup up to 4 x BRI (which is what fits into one case), Linux

Q: How does establishing and ending a connection work with D64S 
   without signaling?
A: The data are simply sent out! If you at the end of the D64S or 2MB
   line, you tell your router that the line itself is "up". You have -
   other than with ping etc. - NO possibility to recognize whether the
   connection is there or not.  (with ISPA for example, the out-going
   wheels turn...)  The only thing that you can measure on your site
   is the loop to the next switching station. If you used Bchan2
   instead of Bchan1 and send out data, they have to come back. Then
   you can take your statistics. The assumes that the Telekom has the
   unused Bchan setup this way at the switching station. This way we
   once proved to the Telekom the line itself had a broken cable...
   What can happen, if you don't autuomattically assume that the line
   is there, that no data will flow if the other side is not yet
   "up". With ISPA, for example, the pseudo numbers 1tap or 2tap are
   first called with the first data packets and the protocol is
   started. Incoming packets are simply ignored, among other reasons
   because of the missing signaling. Only S01 or S02 lines have a D
   channel and have something to use with signaling, however the best
   known solutions also use this 16kb for data transfers to get 144kb
   instead of 128kb.  So just try it by sending out the data, assuming
   that line is there :-). In this case the data end up in Nirvana...

           That surely works. We have it working here. It's also stable
        (kernel >2.0.26 is necessary, otherwise the router might come
        to a halt). Only, if you pull out the plug to the terminal 
        adapter and insert it again, or if the Telekom produces an error,
        then you have to have both sides hang up once (or twice) to 
        bring the connection backup. In emergency you have have a "ping"

        other docs or source code, but I'd be happy to help with any
        further questions, since other helped me before
           There are several things to watch out for. LEASEDx is the
        incoming number on the device; an outgoing number is not
        necessary, since the kernel (or the firmware, I'm not sure)
        generates pseudo-incoming calls, as long as noone has "picked
        up".  In LEASED x, the small "x" should be replaced by the
        number of the SO interface.
           In each of our routers we have four interfaces (numbered as
        0, 1, 2, 3), and I used the last interface as the LEASED line.
        That makes sense, since the other three interfaces are used for
        6 B channels for dial-up lines, and the kernel always uses the
        first free line for outgoing calls. If the leased line were on 
        interface 0, then the second B channel of the leased line would
        appear (but only appear) to be free. The kernel doesn't notice
        (because of the active card) that there is no D channel for 
        dialing there, and will dial, and dial, and dial.
          For this reason, I've created an extra ISDN network interface
        and have bound it exclusively to the apparent B channel of the
        leased line, so that after 6 dial-out lines are in use the
        kernel attempt to dial out on the leased line. 
          Another important stumbling block is that the first pseudo-
        incoming call must be answered (otherwise only the third, then
        the fifth will work, I don't know exactly why, but I suspect
        it's caused by the two B channels, for which calls are generated
        in turn, while a D64 has only one B channel).
        The immediate acceptance of the call is set-up as follows:
        * Load the module for the ICN card and configure (load the firmware,
          bus reject, ...) BUT NOT YET icnctrl -d XXX leased" 
        * Generate the network interface for the kernel with innumber LEASEDx
          and all the other stuff you need (IP Adcress, ...).
          Don't forget to bind to the appropriate S0 interface.
        * NOW: icnctrl -d XXX leased
        The network interface has to already be up weh "icnctrl -d XXX leased"
        is called. Then this command starts the first call and can then be 
        immediately answered -  and pop, the connection is made.

     The resolution of the timer in Linux is only 20ms, so
     ICN_TIMER_BCREAD=0 does nothing. In addition, this is only a
     cosmetic problem. Both (sending and receiving) routines empty the
     queue.  i.e when there is real traffic, in each cycle is not only
     just one fragment sent, but up to 16.  The card buffer contains 16
     fragments. Only with ping and Co. is this visible. FTP (or also
     Z-Modem overr ttyI) can do close to 8k cps without problem. In
     addition, in each cycle both directions are served, so the
     calculation 20ms-receive + 20ms-send is therefore incorrect.  Even
     not considering this, 40ms is a really good value. Many ISDN

!3SPV

Q: What is a SPV?
A: SPV stands for "semipermanente Verbindung" (semi-permanent connection)
   and is a (soon to be obsolete) specialty of the German Telekom. Like
   a leased line, the calling partner is fixed, however the connection
   is only established as needed (which occurs very quickly, much quicker
   that a dial connection). Since the Telekom can use the line for other 
   things when it's not needed, the SPV is cheaper than a leased line.

Q: How long will there still be SPVs?
A: Steffen Sledz <sledz@dgroup.de> wrote on 5 Dec 1996:

Q: Does isdn4linux support SPVs? How?
A: To switch on the support for SPVs, add an "S" before the number
   to be dialed. This works (quite well) for modem emulations as well
   as for defined network interfaces.


!3Channel bundling

Q: What is channel bundling and how can I use it?
A: Channel bundling is currently supported by isdn4Linux in two variations:!br
     * !b1Raw Bundling!b0 (configuration of so-called slave channels)!br
     * !b1MPPP!b0 (based on syncPPP)!br
   Both variantions have their own advantages and disadvantages. See the following
   questions.

Q: What is raw bundling?
A: Raw bundling works similarly to raw IP, only with several channels.
   Therefore, it has the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of 
   raw IP. Raw bundling requires a network interface for each channel 
   that is used. One network interface, the so-called master interface,
   controls the establishment and breaking of connections. For each 
   further channel, an additional so-called slave interface is configured, 
   that is automatically switched on by the master interface.

Q: How do I use raw bundling?
A: The master interface is created as usual with 
!verbon
       isdnctrl addif <master interface>
!verboff
   and configured. For all required slave channels, slave interfaces 
   are created with the command:
!verbon
       isdnctrl addslave <master interface> <slave interface>
!verboff
   and configuriert as usual (e.g. "isdnctrl sdelay <slave interface> <delay>").

Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of raw bundling?
A: Raw bundling has all the advantages and disadvantages of raw IP.
   Compared to MPPP, raw bundling has the advantage that isdn4linux
   itself can open and close the needed slave channels. Unfortunately
   raw bundling still has problems with transfer rates. See the further
   questions below.
   
Q: Is there are working example script for raw bundling?
A: Ja, the FAQ editors have such a script from Robert O'Kane
   <okane@em.uni-frankfurt.de>. Es can be obtained either from Robert 
   or from us.

Q: What's the current situation with raw bundling?

   Robert O'Kane <okane@em.uni-frankfurt.de> ergänzte am 1. Feb 1997:
     I now use 2.0.28 and HiSax 1.5 with NO difference in bandwidth.
   (I also choose 70 for the CPS trigger and 30 seconds slave delay).
     Could you also try setting isdnctrl verbose 4 and watch the bogocps
   calculations for the channels during a ftp transfer. What I think you
   will see is that some of the channels don't send at full speed. I think
   this is a problem with the kernel/IRQ interaction not feeding the
   channels enough data. Could it be that the kernel buffers are not large
   enough for more that 3 channels of data? This could be an explaination
   of why the user-space PPP program can get more data our and into the
   kernel.


Q: What is MPPP?
A: MPPP or MP or MPP (Warning: MP is also an acronym for 'Multi Processor')
   stands for Multi Point to Point and means bundling of several channels to
   one logical stream. To enable MPPP negotiation you must call the ipppd with
   the "+mp" option.  You must also configure a slave device for every
   additional channel (see the i4l manual for more). To use channel bundling
   you must first activate the 'master' or initial call. Now you can add the
   slave channels with the command:
!verbon
       isdnctrl addlink <device>
!verboff
   e.g:
!verbon
       isdnctrl addlink ippp0
!verboff
   This is different to other encapsulations of isdn4linux! With syncPPP,
   there is no automatic activation of slave devices.

!old
Q: How can I use the MPPP material?
A: To use the MPPP material, you have to configure a slave device with
   ISDN4Linux. ipppd can then be started with the "+mp" option. To increase the
   number of open connections, use the "addlink" option of the "isdnctrl"
   command. In the file etc/rc.isdn.syncppp.MPPP in the isdn4kernel-util
   Package you can find an example script.

Q: What are the advantages and disadvatages of MPPP?
A: A disadvantage is that the slave channel has to be activated 
   "manually". ipppd cannot by itself turn the slave channel on and
   off as it needs to. The normal automatic functions of ipppd are 
   either unreliable (auto hangup) don't work at all (auto dial).
   This is not true for the other encapsulations. The transfers
   rates are very good (ca. 30 KB/s with 4 channels).

!old
Q: I tried MPPP but it doesn't work. The ipppd writes in the debug log
   something like:

!2Troubleshooting

!3General

Q: My isdn4linux doesn't work! How do I best go about finding the problem?
A: The following steps are recommended:!br!br
!verbon
   1. First, check everything is working when booting.
      Are there unusual error messages in /var/log/messages?
      Are all programs active that should be started at boot (check with
      ps, or fuser /dev/xxx)? HiSax won't start if something isn't right.
      The old Teles driver, on the other hand, will appear to start even if
      it is not working. See the questions under Troubleshooting!Teles.
   2. Second, try calling with a telephone. The number should be shown in
      /var/log/messages. Otherwise, perhaps the driver was incorrectly 
      started?!
   3. Third, continue experimenting using modem emulation. Because of the 
      differently service recognition, you can't get the telephone or fax to
      ring, so we have to try something else. Open 2 different consoles as 
      root, and on each run "minicom -s"... in the first set "Serial Port
      Setup!Serial Device" to /dev/ttyI0, and the other to /dev/ttyI1. Then 
      choose "Exit" and start the modem emulation with "ATZ" and "AT&Exxxxxx"
      (where xxxxxx is your own MSN without the area code). Then you can start
      On the first console you can dial your own number with ATDxxxxxx. On the
      second console you should now see "CALLER NUMBER: xxxxxxx" and "RING".
      Accept the call on the second console with "ATA", and you should then 
      see the message "CONNECT 64000/X.75" on both consoles. You can then send
      characters to the other console by typing (to see the characters on your
      own console, turn on local echo).!br!br
   4. Fourth, try calling a known ISDN BBS. If you don't know of any, try 
      Gernot (see "Are there sites that offer guest access where I can test my
      isdn4linux setup?"). If you have problems with the modem emulation, see
      "Troubleshooting!Modem Emulation"!br!br
   5. Fifth, try configuring the network interface or ipppd. Experience shows 
      that they cause beginners (and not only beginners!) the most problems.
      To make things easier and you're happy with asyncPPP (to see what 
      asyncPPP means, see the question "pppd, ipppd, syncPPP, asyncPPP - 
      what is that? What should I use?"), you can use the normal pppd with
      modem emulation (i.e. /dev/ttyI*). 
!verboff      
   Otherwise, it is highly recommended
   that use an example script form the Howto (see the question "Where can 
   I find scripts and other information on configuring i4l?"). For testing
   you can try your own provider or of the guest accounts (see "Are there 
   sites that offer guest access where I can test my isdn4linux setup?").
   The latter have the advantage of being able to see the log files as well
   as a stable, working configuration. For example, if accessing via ipppd 
   doesn't work, you can log in via modem or modem emulation to find out
   what happened on the other side. Not all providers are so 
   cooperative.... :-)

Q: Why does niether my telephone nor my fax machine ring when I call 
   them with isdn4linux?
A: Isdn4linux sets "digital data" as it's own service when it calls out.

   a telephone or a fax machine.

Q: If i4l uses one B-channel then the other one will be blocked (incoming as
   well as outgoing)
A: This behavior is typical for a cable with confused a/b wiring. Some NT from
   Quante had a wrong labeling. They caused exactly the mentioned behavior if
   the PBX was connected to the plug of the NT and the ISDN card to the pins
   of the NT. As soon as some device activates the bus the other one can no
   longer get through.

   I'm assuming that you have connected the Teles not with the

   Then open it up and switch a1 and b1. Try it out. If it doesn't
   work, put them back and switch a2 and b2. If it still doesn't work,
   try swichting them both, although then I'd suspect that the RJ45
   cable from the Telekom is crossed (which would then switch _both_).
   As long as {a|b}1 and {a|b}2 are kept, nothing can break. If you
   want to be sure, before plugging it in measure between pins
   4 and 5 and between Pins 2 and 6 on the socket; there should be no
   current, but between 3 and 4 and between 6 and 5 should be 40 V,
   6 and 3 positive!br
   If both devices are attached via RJ45, then one of the cables
   has been twisted. That usually happens if one of the RJ45 plugs
   has been attached upside-down (a1/b1 are inside, a2/b2 are outside,
   so the oder of the sending/receving pairs is maintained), then
   you just need a new plug and of course pliers for the RJ45, old
   plug off, and new plug (in the right direction) on.!br

Q: Even though I deactivated the signalling for incoming calls, an incoming

   is true when I deactivate audio support for i4l.
A: i4l misbehaves by sending an ALERT when the telecom

Q: I get many "HSCX RME out of buffers" messages in my syslog.
A: Answer by Jan den Ouden <denouden@groovin.xs4all.nl>:
     The "HSCX RME out of buffers" message means that there are no more
     receive buffers available. Received frames are only processed every few
     milliseconds and in the meantime the frames have to be buffered. Default
     are 6 buffers. Each frame needs a buffer no matter how big it is. If a
     number of very small frames arrive within a short time period it can
     happen that the buffers are overrun. At least it seems that this happens.
     In teles.h there are three lines for number and size of those buffers:
!verbon
       #define HSCX_RBUF_ORDER 1 
       #define HSCX_RBUF_BPPS 2 
       #define HSCX_RBUF_MAXPAGES 3 
!verboff
     The size of each buffer is about
!verbon
       (4096<<HSCX_RBUF_ORDER)/HSCX_RBUF_BPPS 
!verboff
     This would lead to buffer with a size of about 4k. The number of buffers
     is MSCX_RBUF_BPPS*HSCX_RBUF_MAXPAGES, which normally gives 6. You can
     increase that number by increasing HSCX_RBUF_MAXPAGES. This is just a
     limit, there is no buffer allocation when they are not needed.

!3Teles driver


!old
Q: How can I know that my Teles card (or compatible) is recognized correctly?
A: On bootup there has to be a message like "kernel: HSCX version A:5 B:5" as
   well as "kernel: channels 2" in /var/log/messages. "A:4 B:4" is also o.k.
   All other values (especially "A:0 B:0" or "A:f B:f") show that the card
   is not used correctly.

Q: What is the name if my Teles driver (especially if compiled into the
   kernel)?
A: The name is what was given as "teles_id" when loading as a module. If lilo
   is used, the name is also that what is given with "teles_id". If the Teles
   driver is compiled into the kernel, the the name is simply "" (two double 
   quotation marks). The name can be found out with "cat /dev/isdninfo"; it's
   shown with "idmap".

!old
Q: On bootup I get "HSCX version A:5 B:5" but I still have the impression that
   my Teles card is not used correctly. What else can I check?
A: Wilhelm Schulte <schulte@wrds1.urz.uni-wuppertal.de> wrote about this:
!verbon
     Best is you check that the interrupt is registered correctly. Check it
     with "cat /proc/interrupts". The following entry indicates an error:
       11:        0 + teles
     The 11 is correct when the Teles card is configured on interrupt 11.
     However, the 0 means that the Teles card does not accept interrupts, so it
     does not work. That's the well known "busy bug". Often it can be worked
     around by loading, unloading, and reloading the ISDN modules on bootup.
     The IRQ counter does have to be 0; low values also point to the same
     problem. You can test for it quite easily:
     1. cat /proc/interrups, note the count
     2. Call the card with a telephone.
     3. Again cat /proc/interrupts, the count should be quite
        different from the first value.

   This is normal. AVM (and ELSA as well) have a timer on the card.
   Since AVM doesn't cooperate, I don't know how to turn it off. With
   the Elsa I know how, but don't do it since here hardly any performance
   is lost and I use the interrupts for status reports (which is very
   handy for development; as soon the the driver was ready, nothing blinked

   during connections.

Q: The PNP tools done work with my Teles 16.3 PNP card!

!3Modem emulation (use with ttyI* devices)


Q: When I dial with "ATD....." I always get a "NO CARRIER".

   own MSN; with 1TR6 give the one-digit EAZ).

!old
Q: My modem emulation/pppd does not recognize an incoming call.
A: Probably you did not tell the modem emulation with "AT&E" which MSN to use.
   For example, use "AT&E123456" if your MSN is 123456.

!old
Q: I gave the correct MSN/EAZ, but still don't get a RING.
A: If you put a getty to a cui* device it will never get a RING. That's not
   i4l's fault, but the kernel's. HIGHLY RECOMMENED: always use the /dev/ttyI*
   devices! Since there is mgetty there is no need to use different devices for
   incoming and outgoing calls. (The same goes for the normal /dev/ttyS* and
   /dev/cua* devices for the serial interface.)

Q: Why can't I dial my telephone or fax with the modem emulation?
A: ISDN differentiates different services. All outgoing calls with the 
   modem emulation use the service "Digital Data", which is incompatible
   with telephone or fax, so the call never gets through.

!old
Q: I can't get a connection to my ISDN mailbox.
A: There are several possible protocoll parameters. There is hdlc, there is
   X.75 and there are several possible block sizes with X.75. You can tell
   the modem emulation about the block size with "AT&B". Mostly used is a block
   size of 2048 byte: "AT&B2048". The teles driver can not process blocks
   longer than 2048 bytes (ICN can handle up to 4000 bytes).

Q: I'm sure I used the correct parameters for my ISDN mailbox, but I still
   don't get a connection. I always get BUSY although I know the mailbox is not
   busy.
A: Sometimes there is an interrupt problem with the teles driver. Check the
   interrupt count for your teles card. If "cat /proc/interrupts" just gives
   you 0 then the following workaround may help you:
   Configure your drivers as modules. When booting load them (insmod/modprobe),
   then immediately unload them (rmmod) and reload them (insmod/modprobe).

Q: Starting ipppd I get the error message "this systems lacks ppp support".
A: Check whether the device "ippp0" exists (i.e. with the program "ifconfig").
   The ipppd *needs* this device with exactly *that* name. If it doesn't exist
   one has to define it:
!verbon
     isdnctrl addif ippp0
     isdnctrl encap ippp0 syncppp
     ... (see i4l documentation for more information) ...

   Maybe you compiled ipppd with the source of another kernel that you are not
   using...
   See alsp the question "How should I name my network interface?"
   under "Sync PPP" in the "Configuration" section.

Q: How can I switch on ppp support for my kernel 1.2.13 (needed for ipppd)?
A: Stefan A. Muehlenweg <Stefan.A.Muehlenweg@samhh.hanse.de> wrote:
!verbon
     In 1.2.13 you tell the kernel *not* to include ppp support, then compile
     the kernel, *after that* do a 'make modules' and a 'make modules_install'.
     This way everything that's not compiled into the kernel, but that can be
     loaded as modules is prepared for loading via insmod. 'modprobe ppp' on
     bootup (in the rc.xxx script) will load the ppp module and all
     additionally needed modules (slhc etc).
     Prerequisite for ipppd with 1.2.13: install ppp version 2.2.0c. Also in
     the kernel sources (ppp-2.2.0c.tar.gz). And you need modutils 1.2.8
     (modules-1.2.8.tar.gz).

Q: When I start ipppd, I only get error messages from the i4l driver.
A: When ipppd is started, it calls functions that can trigger a network
   packet (e.g. gethostbyname()). Without ipppd (since at this time, ipppd
   it has not been fully started), this network access cannot be processed,
   You should try to put the needed hostnames in the local /etc/hosts or
   in some way define the name so that it can be resolved without having
   the access the ISDN/ippp interface.

Q: When I try to start ipppd it says "Can't find usable ippp device"
A: Frank Meyer <fm@textware.k.eunet.de> wrote:
!verbon
     I had the same problem. Interestingly, after about 5 minutes with
     several of those messages the ipppd said "started". And then it
     worked!  Well, I included several test prints into the ipppd
     source and located the problem: The ipppd calculates a random
     number on startup (forgot where) and uses gethostid() for
     that. That causes a DNS lookup. Then linux tries to find the
     nameserver mentioned in /etc/resolv.conf.  As ipppd isn't up it
     can't reach the name server, which gives those messages.  The
     solution was easy: I not only included my computer in /etc/hosts
     with its short name (z.B.  isdn), but also its full name
     including the domain in /etc/resolv.conf:
       x.x.x.x isdn isdn.who.knows.where
     Then it stopped complaining and just runs!  Even earlier there is
     a call from main() to setipdefault(), which (in options.c) calls
     gethostbyname().  This also causes a DNS lookup and the message
     "isdn_ppp_bind: Can't find usable ippp device".  So two lines in
     the source have to be changed to avoid the DNS lookup.  It's
     easier to include your own name in /etc/hosts, I used the ip
     address of my ethernet card.

Q: I can't get a connect. How can I find out where the problem is?
A: The output of ipppd is very helpful... Check whether you can find:
!verbon
   - a few "LCP-conf-req SENT" messages (less than ten) and then a
     "TERM-REF":
     -> check whether the ISDN card was configured properly. It seems the
        computer doesn't dial (IRQ, IO, protocoll wrong?)
   - at least a few "RECV" messages
     -> good: the card is dialing and the and your dialin computer tries
        to communicate. Maybe the authentification doesn't work. Check the
        ipppd configuration!
   - the message that ipppd was exited for some reason

     Please downgrade to 2.0.14... In later version (since 2.0.16) there is a

     2.0.14 until the bugfix finds its way into the new kernels.

Q: I get the message "IP frames delayed" - and I don't get a connection.
A: See last question:
   You may have forgotten to use "isdnctrl dial ippp*" before using a net

!old
Q: I cannot dial out with "isdnctrl dial ippp0". It seems as if the route to
   ipppd is missing although I *did* set it ("network unreachable"). With my
   old kernel < 2.0 everything works fine!
A: In the newer kernels you have to place "route" as the very last command
   before the dialout command. Otherwise the kernel will delete the route.

!old
Q: After ipppd dials out my default route is gone.
A: It's the kernel's fault. Newer kernels (>= 2.0) have some changes in the
   routing. Workaround: install a script /etc/ppp/ip-up like this:

Q: When dialing out, I get the message "pppd: peer authentication
   required but no authentication files accessible." What does this mean?
A: Most likely the option "auth" was set by mistake. Then the !u1other!u0 
   side is required to be authorized.

Q: I cannot establish a connection -  it's rejected by the other side.
   In the log file I find a message that's something like: "sent [0]
   [LCP ConfReq id=0x1 <mru 1500> <auth pap> <magic 0xcd12e9c4>"
A: Like in the last question, an option was been set that requires the
   !u1other!u0 side to be authorized. These options shouldn't be set.
   Possible candidates are: "+pap" as well as "+chap".

Q: I cannot establish a connection -  it's rejected by the other side.
   In the log file I find a message that's something like:  "sent [0]
   [LCP ConfRej id=0x1 <auth pap>"
A: Your computer is refusing to identify itself with user name (e.g. XXX) 
   and password (e.g. YYY). That only works the the authorization options
   "user XXX" and "remotename YYY" together with a correct (!)
   /etc/ppp/pap-secrets. With a password of ZZZ it should ideally look
   like this:
!verbon
        XXX YYY ZZZ
!verboff
   If that doesn't you, you can use wild cards, something like:
!verbon
        * * ZZZ
!verboff
   Then !u1every!u0 partner has the password ZZZ. If chap is required
   for authorization, then /etc/ppp/chap-secrets mut be set up correctly.
   Important : the format is different from that of pap-secrets!

     I had exactly the same problem/the same error message. The cause for it

     server, secret), but not a fourth one (ip adresses). BUT: after the third
     entry were some BLANKs. After removing the trailing BLANKs and/or TABs
     (i)pppd is now very satisfied with my auth-files.

Q: I often get the error message "hscx_empty_fifo: incoming packet too large"
A: Probably one of the compressions is activated (i4l can't handle those very

Q: The connection with ipppd seems to work, but eventually it crashes.
A: It could be that some compression is activated (that i4l can't handle
   properly). Common error: "-vj" has to be used *additionally* to "-vjccomp"
   (it completly switchs off the VJ compression) - the example scripts coming
   with ipppd don't have that option included already.
   Other compression modes (bsd, pccomp) can cause trouble, too.

           We are an ISP here in Dresden and use Linux (among other systems)
        for our access (with I4L as well as with external terminal adapters).
        We have this problem mostly with Windows 95 and NT customers who
        are using the "included" (modem network) software. It doesn't make
        any difference whether the customer is dialing with async or sync PPP.
        It also doesn't matter which modem emulation he is using on his side.
        What they have in  is that the connection is made with Microwoft
        modem adapter + Microsoft PPP (although a colleague recently told me
        about a similar problem with a Macintosh customer).
           Since it doesn't matter to PPP who is the server and who is the
        clinet, ask your ISP what kind of hardware you are dialing into (we
        have had >>no<< problems with Linux customers and Trumpet Winsock
        users, therefore I suspect a bug in MS-PPP).
           The following workaround usually works for us: (it's not a cure,
        but helps to reduce the pain...)
          * Reduce the Max MTU to 576 or even (296)
          * Reduce the  DefaultRcvWindow to 2144
        On the Windows 95 side these are 2 Registry entries; on the Linux
        side tou can set "mtu 576" and "mru 576" in the  ppp options.

Q: The first ip packet gets lost on automatic dialout with dynamic ip address
   allocation.
A: There are some dialout problems in connection with sync ppp and dynamic ip
   address allocation. In this case your ip address will change while packets
   are waiting to be sent. All packets that should be sent before the change
   in ip address are "hung".
   Workaround:
   Before connecting with telnet, ping, or the like dial out manuelly with
   "isdnctrl dial ippp*".

     Yesterday I got a permanent ip address and since then the automatic dial-

     also over the V.34 modem). I had the same symptoms there in the past.
     Summary: When using automatic (!) dialout you definitely need a permanent
     ip address. If you start and end your connection manually (!) then you can
     live with dynamic address allocation.
     It surely is time to extend ppp's functionality to not only hold outgoing
     packets that initiate a connection, but also correct the ip address to the
     new address before sending it out. The same goes for other packets that
     arrive before the connection is up.
     Also diald has to get that functionality to control when the connection
     goes up or down.

   A suggested solution came from Erik Corry <erik@arbat.com> on 
   5 Jan 1997:
!verbon
        1) No local name server/name server cache
        2) Local squid proxy WWW server (and Netscape must use it).
        3) set positive_dns_ttl to 1 in /usr/local/squid/etc/squid.conf
           so squid doesn't cache IP asdresses
          Now the connection will always start with a DNS lookup,
        which is immune to IP address changes (because it runs on
        UDP and not TCP?). If you have other programs that cache
        IP addresses, you'll have to figure you how to get around
        them. Normally a program caches an IP address when it
        has to connect twice to the same server. That isn't a
        problem, of course, when the second connection occurs so
        quickly after the first that the dial-on-demand connection
        is still the same.

Q: My vboxgetty does not answer any incoming calls.

Q: My vboxgetty answers at the first ring but the number of rings is set to 4.
A: The rings are created by a timer in the isdn module that doesn't

!3Dialout on demand

Q: What can cause a charge unit disaster?
A: There are several possibilites.!br
   1. "Bridging" was compiled into the kernel (see the appropriate question
   below).!br
   2. Broadcasts from the interfaces ware being forwarded by ISDN (see 
   the appropriate question below).!br
   3. If IP connections are still open with the line is disconnected and
   IP addresses are dynamically assigned, then the disaster is inevitable.
   Then a new connection is started to bring down the open IP connections,
   which fails because the IP address is now different. The line is hung up,
   but the IP connections are still open, the line is dialed again, and
   so on... (see the appropriate question below).

Q: Ever since I installed a new kernel, my computer constantly open ISDN
   connections without transferring any data (expensive!).
A: Maybe the kernel option "bridging" was mistakenly activated?

Q: My router wants to constanly dial out (and does it too) but !u1NO!u0

   ARP requests or broadcasts? You should run ifconfig with the options
   -arp and -broadcast to keep from opening connections in this way.

Q: After closing the line, I discover with "netstat -nt" that IP connections
   are still open. How can I close these manually?
A: Gernot Zander <hifi@scorpio.in-berlin.de> wrote on 18 Jan 1997:!br
   You can bring the interface "down" then back "up". When you do this, it
   will try to dial out. But if you have removed the outgoing telephone
   number, then "no outgoing number..." appears in the syslog, and as soon
   as the interface is "up", all connections will be closed.

Q: How can I safely turn off dialout on demand?

   For me, what is happening is what you want: the the ISDN system is 
   "down", Netscape immediately shows an error message a la: "the Server 
   doesn't have a DNS entry" or something similar. You probably have to
   delete the route so that this will happen. I do it like this:
!verbon
        /sbin/route del default
        /sbin/isdnctrl system off
        /sbin/ifconfig ippp0 down
!verboff
   An to get things running again:
!verbon
        /sbin/isdnctrl system on
        /sbin/ifconfig ippp0 up 
        /sbin/route add $GATE-IP dev ippp0
        /sbin/route add default ippp0

   [The latter method has the disadvantage that dial-in is then no longer 
   possible - Ed.]

Q: How else can I prevent the charge unit disaster?
A: In the next version of isdnlog (>2.52) it will be able to work as a
   watchdog and prevent such dial-outs (with a reboot, if necessary).

Q: Is it possible that even with a crashed computer a ISDN connection

   However, i4l runs the ISAC in nonauto mode, meaning that when interrupts
   are no longer being process, the connection is broken after a maximum
   of about 1/2 a minute. This is not the reason for using nonauto mode, but

Q: How can I get sendmail to not initiate any connections without local

A: First you have to get sendmail to no long open any DNS connections.
   You need to activate the following features: "nodns", "nocanonify".!br
   If you have a smarthost, you need to make sure that this name does not
   call the name server. You can either set it directly as an IP address,
   or add the name to /etc/hosts (/etc/host.conf should then contain
   "order hosts bind")!br
   You should set all non-local mailers as "expensive"
   ("define(SMTP_MAILER_FLAGS, e)"), and then forbid sendmail with
   "define(`confCON_EXPENSIVE', `True')" from automatically connection
   to expensive mailers. The call to sendmail should no longer include
   a time for the "-q" option (e.g. only "-bd -os -q"). "-os" means that
   all mail will be queued (which won't prevent local mail from being
   delivered immediately). The only catch is that when booting, mail that
   might still be in the queze will be sent by sendmail, even though the
   network is not yet up. Therefore, when booting you should remove 
   all mail from /var/mquere before starting sendmail, and then return it 
   once sendmail has been started.!br
   Mail to expensive mailers will now only be send with the explicit
   call "sendmail -q".

   you can also set up a cache daemon that saves pages that are often needed.!br
   A proxy should not cause a dial out, even when the complete name is

A: Torsten Hentschel <Torsten.Hentschel@DInet.de> wrote on 3 Oct 1996:
!verbon
     A Cisco may dial so heavily that the ipppd has no chance to callback.
     That's how they are programmed (firm statement of a Cisco developer):
       If a Cisco receives a packet that should be routed through a "dial on
       demand" telephone connection, and there is a D-channel available for
       dialing out it dials out immediately.
     If in such a situation (which has be the case with Delta Internet for half
     a year now) a Cisco with 8 D-channels is on the other side and somebody
     does a simple "ping <RemoteIP>" then the Cisco will use (worst case) all
     8 D-channels to dial out. Of course it can't dial the same telephone
     number with two D-channels in parallel (would be immediately busy). Its
     programming is not so stupid, but it sets up the next D-channel for
     dialout before it assumes the previous D-channel as failed. Such a Cisco
     works like a machine gun in respect to dialout. And i4l won't get a free
     D-channel for dialin if the Cisco doesn't want.
     The bad thing: a Cisco always expects (even when configured on "callback
     client" = i4l dials back) that the other side unhooks the line, then both
     hang up and then comes the callback. Username and password always have to
     be exchanged before the callback is allowed when using ppp, to be sure
     that the person requesting callback is allowed to do so. (Cisco seems to
     obey the rules of the [German] Telekom that no information are to be ex-
     changed without a B-channel connection. A callback request just by caller
     id could in doubt be considered as a transmission of information).

Q: Some the callbacks confuse the module count. How can I now unload

A: Karsten Keil <keil@temic-ech.spacenet.de> has as a temporary workaround
   added two "secret" telesctrl commands:

Q: SyncPPP works without problems on one channel. Unfortunately MPPP won't work
   due to communication problems between ipppd and the other side.

     At first about your bug: the other side does not like the MP-MRU (0x5dc)
     but wants a smaller one (0x5d7) ... which is what ipppd doesn't like (bug)
     ... Just try 0x5d7 as MP-MRU.
     Without a MP-MRU agreed about MPPP won't switch on .. which is why it is

!3Germany (1TR6)


!old
Q: Which EAZ should I use for i4l?
A: You can use all available EAZ. However, two EAZ have a special meaning and
   can cause problems:
!verbon
     EAZ 0: global call (all telephones ring)
     EAZ 9: global call (no telephone rings)
!verboff

Q: Ich use 1TR6 on an extension - the extension number has more than one
   digit (e.g. 206). What is my EAZ?
A: Jens Ey <jens@jeyhh.shnet.org> wrote on 10 Jan 1997:!br
   The EAZ for extensions is usually the last digit of the extension number.
   As EAZ for the Linux computer you should then enter a '6'.

!old
Q: The state machine hangs with 1TR6.
A: Karsten Keil <isdn4@temic-ech.spacenet.de> has fixed that with the new
   "HiSax" driver.

Q: What does our MSN look like?
A: In The Netherlands the MSN includes (as opposed to the German 
   Telekom) !u1also the area code!u0 - but without the leading zero. 
   If your telephone number were 01234-56789, then it would be 
   configured as follows:
!verbon
        * Modem emulation:
          "AT&e123456789" (without leading zero)
        * Network interfaces:
          "isdnctrl eaz <interface> 123456789" (without leading zero)
          For test calls to yourself:
          "isdnctrl addphone <interface> in 123456789" (without leading zero)
          "isdnctrl addphone <interface> out 0123456789" (with leading zero)

Q: How can I get isdnlog to calcuate the charges according the to the rules
   of the Dutch telephone company?
A: See this question udner "isdnlog" in the section "Configuration".

Q: Are there any other peculiarities?
A: It is thought that the Dutch telephone company at night sometimes loses
   a TEI. See the question "On my ELSA card, the LED for the loss of the TEI 
   often blinks. My connections are also often disrupted..."

!3Austria

!old
Q: We have neither an MSN nor an EAZ, only a normal plain telephone number.
   What do we have to use for i4l?
A: Bernhard Kruepl <b.kruepl@ieee.org> wrote
!verbon
     In Austria you always have to use "0" as the ingoing EAZ/MSN for the  
     first (or only). Any further MSNs can be set normally.
!verboff

!old
Q: Incoming and outgoing calls won't work ("incoming call without CPN")
A: In Austria ISDN lines are by standard installed !u1without!u0 MSN (which is
   different from Germany). That means when somebody calls the installed ISDN
   number the called party gets signalled a "global call". i4l then says
   "incoming call without CPN" - "CPN" means called party number.
   Solution: Set the incoming "MSN" (in reality: none) to "0", then i4l
   responds to the global call. Otherwise it waits for the signalling of the
   number you told i4l, and that won't happen (happens only for *additional*
   MSN).!br
   On the other hand you should set the outgoing MSN correctly (without area
   code) -- however, a wrong MSN will be replaced with the correct one by your
   telecomunication provider.

!old
Q: Why doesn't my getty answer the EAZ it should respond to if somebody dials
   the "0", the broadcast number? In the log file it says "Incoming call
   without CPN, assuming '0'".
A: CPN=Called Party Number, the number of your own side. It's missing, that's
   why i4l assumes "0". If the getty is configured on another number but "0" it
   will not respond. Let somebody dial with a telephone on the EAZ of your
   getty and check whether all telephones are ringing or just that that that
   was set to the EAZ of your getty. It could also be an error of your
   telephone company.


!3Switzerland

Q: We have neither an MSN nor an EAZ, just a plain telephone number. What do we
   have to use for i4l?
A: Herbert Rosmanith <herp@wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at> wrote:
   In Switzerland you have to use the !u1last number!u0 of your telephone
   number as your MSN/EAZ ("6" if you have the telephone number "123456").

!old
Q: I can only keep a 184 second connection with i4l. After that the connection
   breaks with cause "Temporary failure" since the telephone company uses new
   software for its equipment.
A: That is a bug in i4l - Q.931 demands that there has to be an answer to
   a "STATUS ENQUIRY" frame. This is not yet programmed in i4l.
   Karsten Keil <isdn4@temic-ech.spacenet.de> has fixed it now in the new
   "HiSax" driver. There is a patch named STATUS for the Teles driver.
   See also the question General|HiSax and the section about the HiSax driver.

Q: How can I get isdnlog to calcuate the charges according the to the rules
   of the Swiss telephone company?
A: See this question udner "isdnlog" in the section "Configuration".



!3Portugal

Q: What should we use as MSN?
A: As long as only one telephone number or MSN was applied for, the telephone
   company sends no caller ID. Therefore the MSN should be set to "0".
   If more than one MSNs was applied for, then these should be set as usual.

Q: Why can't I use European ISDN cards in North America?
A: In Europe, the telephone company normally makes the network terminator
   (NTBA) available. In North America !u1the customer!u0 has to supply such
   such a device(NT-1) himself! Therefore, most ISDN cards offer an 
   integrated NT-1.!br
   There are also other differences; e.g. in Europe a PRI (Primary
   Rate Interface) has 30 B channels, in Northe America only 23.

Q: Which protocol is used in North America?
A: NI-1 is used - it's related to DSS1. Both are Q.931 Protocols, but 
   have totally different groups of functions and are therefore not 
   compatible to one other.    


!2Miscellaneous


!old
Q: How can I set the clock of my computer with ISDN?
A: Isdnlog offers this feature with option "-t". Unfortunately, the seconds are
   not transmitted via ISDN, and the transmitted time is not very accurate -
   depending on the ISDN equipment of your telephone company there may be a
   deviation of several minutes (!).
   It's better to get a PC clock that is set by radio signals and check it with,
   for example, xntp. You can also use a time server in the internet with
   "netdate" or "rdate". One time server can be found in Cologne:
   time.rrz.uni-koeln.de, but there are many more.

Q: Where can I find information on the dip switches of my NTBA?
A: !link ftp://novix.oih.rwth-aachen.de/pub/ntba.zip; (ca. 170kB)

Q: Can I connect two ISDN devices directly with a kind of "null modem cable"?
A: No, that's not possible. The concept of ISDN doesn't allow it. A NTBA or a
   PBX with an internal bus is required.
