Hello!
after some tweaking and testing I have solved the problem with
the checksum errors. ( Apparently and hopefully, up to now no
more error messages)
Because of the slowness of my computer (thanks Fritz!) I have done
two things:
a) changed the IRQ from 15 to 5 for the Teles card -> the Teles is now
on the Master controller
b) got irqtune and changed the priority for the teles card to maximum
in favour of disk. ( irqtune 5 )
With this two changes I was able to cure my errors from HiSax:
MASQ: failed TCP/UDP checksum from xx.xx.xx.xx!
for the Teles-driver the following error messages:
Teles: 	HSCX RDO mode=2
	HSCX B EXIR 40
Possibly the first solution would be sufficient, but what the heck,
don't touch a running system.

The original message is included below and yes I know my reply address
is wrong and should be heiling@online-club.de. I will fix
this really soon now, if my new Debian CD has arrived.
Thanks
