Modified libcapi20 by Jan-Michael Brummer.

For remote configuration the library looks for
  ~/.capi20rc
and if it doesn't exist it looks for
  /etc/capi20.conf

To set the remote machine, the above file need to have
the following line
  REMOTE <driver> <remote hostname|ip-address> <remote port>
 
Drivers:
	* fritzbox	- Remote CAPI via FRITZ!Box
	* rcapi		- Melware Remote CAPI

If this doesn't exist, the library tries the old, normal way
of using the local /dev/capi20.
