ATTENTION .. NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW
********************************

You NEED at least the 2.0.29 base patch because of a new ioctl!! 

changed default pathname for options to:
  /etc/ppp/ioptions
pidfilename changed to:
  ipppd.pid
removed checking of ~/.ppprc file ('options from user' feature)

------------------------------------------------------------

I added a few new options:
 - 'useifip' will get (if not set to 0.0.0.0) the IP address
   for the negotiation from the attached network-interface.
   (also: ipppd will try to negotiate 'pointopoint' IP as remote IP)
		interface address -> local IP
		pointopoint address -> remote IP
 - '+mp' enables MPPP negotiation
 - 'useifmtu': a not so important option .. better use
   the 'mtu' option .. 
 - from the ppp-2.3 package I took the 'noccp' option.
   (-ccp is the same). Necessary for a few 
   netblazers on the remote side.
 - 'usefirstip' gets the remote address from the first entry in
   the auth file (if there is an IP address entry). This address 
   should be a full IP address not an address from a masked area.
   Ipppd calls 'gethostbyname()' and negotiates the result.
   IP from auth file will overwrite the remote address gotten
   from the interface.
   'usefirstip' is UNTESTED!
 - 'callback type[,message]' enables the callback feature
   also UNTESTED!
   ie: 'callback 0'       -> simple callback (info via auth. etc.)
       'callback 3,12346' -> us E.164 (tel) number 123456 for callback
       'callback 6' is different. This value means, that the whole negotiation
   is done with a seperate protocol after the authentification phase. Currently
   it's not possible to set any options in this case. The ipppd accepts
   everything from the remote side.
 - IPX and MS_DNS are now compiled into the binary without additional option
   Applied Hartwig Felgers MS-DNS (re)patch for this
 - added Markus Hofmann's <markus@tower.de> maxconnect patches
 - added 'pidfile <own pidfilename>' option .. 
 - added 'set_userip'  .. you may define valid IPs in /etc/ppp/useriptab
   (it's a patch from: Meno Abels <Meno.Abels@Technical.Adviser.com>)

The ipppd can handle multiple devices. This is necessary to
link several connections together to one bundle.
Also, you only start the ipppd once. It now opens the devices
and waits for connections. 
If you (or the remote side) closes the connection the ipppd
reopens the device automatically. (the device .. not the link
to the remote)
So you shouldn't kill the ipppd to close a link. Instead, trigger
a hangup on the netdevice layer.
(with isdn4linux: isdnctrl hangup <device>')

I applied the mschap80 patches (see README.mschap80), but this
is untested.
I also started to apply the CBCP patches .. not yet finished.
May not work!

I disabled the facility to configure the daemon via
the /dev/ppp/ioptions.<devname> file. It's not necessary.
Use the 'file' option or the command line for individual
configuration.

Better don't set the permissions of the programm to 
'setuid to root on execution'. Call the daemon as root instead.
No common user must call the daemon!

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Corrections for shadow support. This means that the isexpired routine
   has been removed, the references to pw_crypt have been changed to use
   crypt, etc.

   You must, repeat, MUST, have the libcrypt library if you now wish to use
   shadow passwords. The library is available with the crypt library.

2. The corrections for the IPXCP routing code.

3. The addition of a /etc/ppp/auth-up and /etc/ppp/auth-down program. This
   is used to aid implementations which rely upon the in-band authentication
   protocols.

5. The corrections which broken implementations of authentication
   protocol to cause pppd to loop. I am only aware of the Tumpet winsock
   stack which caused this condition.
