Bugs:
=====
* Recording chopped up (only recorded file)
* Incoming delay
* Kernel cpu consumption in conversation mode. This is a kernel-internal
  problem. While reading blocks from kernel OSS devices and ttyI, select(s)
  seems to consume lot's of cpu time in kernel space while NOT BLOCKING!
  -> not a big problem for now, just less idle tasks ;)
  -> The problem doesn't seem to appear with ALSA
