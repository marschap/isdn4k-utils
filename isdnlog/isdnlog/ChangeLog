	* processor.c (decode): Do not append same digits twice to called
	number if DUALFIX_SRCNUM and dualmode are enabled and the outgoing
	call originates from isdn card isdnlog listens to.  In this case,
	SETUP is received twice and decoded in the same chan.  Double
	decoding takes place only if the two SETUP messages are not read
	in succession from /dev/isdnctrl?.  With three or less of these
	conditions, the error did not occur.

	* isdnlog.c (read_param_file): Store value for skipProv from
	parameter file to param_skipprov, a new variable at file scope.
	* isdnlog.c (main): Call add_skipped_provider with param_skipprov
	before initRate.  Added debug info about list of skipped providers,
	output is classified as PRT_DEBUG_GENERAL which seems to be almost
	unused so far.  After initRate and debug output, the list of
	skipped providers is freed.

	* processor.c (buildnumber): Repeat test for special number and
	store only count of matching special number code digits to
	*sonderrufnummer.  This makes a better display when dialing
	special number ABCDEF digit by digit and the ratefile has separate
	entries for special numbers ABCD* and AB* (in this order).

	* isdnlog.c (read_param_file, main): An area code entry in the
	parameterfile replaces the area code entry in the global conffile.
	As the parameter is read before the gobal conffile, param_myarea
	is used as interim storage for the new area code.  Thanks to Per
	Jessen from Zurich for explaining this issue and testing.

	* processor.c (processctrl): Backup and restore call[5] in case of
	two successive SETUP messages, where the second contains a B channel
	specification, so that the information of the first SETUP is not lost.
	This occured with a call originating and terminating at the watched
	ISDN adapter, where SETUP_ACK for the outgoing side showed up after
	the SETUP of the incoming side.  Thanks to Wolfgang Klein from
	Paderborn for providing adequate test data for this and the following
	issue. 

	* processor.c (prepareRate): Use country and area code from configfile
	for rate computation, if the source number is entirely unknown.  This
	is necessary with outgoing calls from other devices, where isdnlog
	only gets the data sent back from the switch.  Without a correct
	source area code, a zonefile is not used and local calls are treated
	as nationwide.

	* isdnlog.c (init_variables): Set ignoreCLIP to 0.
	* isdnlog.c (set_options): Set ignoreCLIP from -Ux[:y] option.
	* isdnlog.c (read_param_file): Set ignoreCLIP from "ignoreCOLP=x[:y]",
	use y value if present, x otherwise.
	* processor.c (decode): Use ignoreCLIP instead of ignoreCOLP for
	control of IE 0x6c (calling party number) handling.

	* processor.c (decode): Changes for IE 0x6c when IE is given twice,
	e.g. source number from user and from network on an incoming call
	(ETS 300 092-1 Annex B).  Use network provided number as source
	number (index [CALLING] for .onum and other in call[chan]) regardless
	ignoreCLIP setting.  ignoreCLIP now only controls the storage of the
	user provided number to [CLIP].  The old effect of ignoreCLIP was to
	look at the first IE only.  Changed the calls of buildnumber and vnum
	in case of number order network/user, so that [CLIP] is set right.
	If there is an alias for the CLIP number, show alias and number in
	parentheses (new) in "CLIP ..." notice.

2004-09-05  Tobias Becker  <tobiasb@isdn4linux.de>

	* isdnlog.h (ignore_unknown_PD): New global variable.
	* isdnlog.c (read_param_file): Store ignoreUPD setting in parameter
	file to ignore_unknown_PD.
	* processor.c (processctrl): Show warning "Unexpected discriminator"
	only if not suppressed by ignore_unknown_PD.

2004-08-25  Tobias Becker  <tobiasb@isdn4linux.de>

	* processor.c (processctrl): Removed declaration of moreinfo, it is
	declared in isdnlog.h.

2004-07-24  Tobias Becker  <tobiasb@isdn4linux.de>

	* start_prog.c (Get_Opts): The call duration \$5 is now 0 until
	a CONNECT occurs.

	* ChangeLog: Started this file.
