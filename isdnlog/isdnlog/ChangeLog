	* isdnlog.c (init_variables): Set ignoreCLIP to 0.
	* isdnlog.c (set_options): Set ignoreCLIP from -Ux[:y] option.
	* isdnlog.c (read_param_file): Set ignoreCLIP from "ignoreCOLP=x[:y]",
	use y value if present, x otherwise.
	* processor.c (decode): Use ignoreCLIP instead of ignoreCOLP for
	control of IE 0x6c (calling party number) handling.

	* processor.c (decode): Changes for IE 0x6c when IE is given twice,
	e.g. source number from user and from network on an incoming call
	(ETS 300 092-1 Annex B).  Use network provided number as source
	number (index [CALLING] for .onum and other in call[chan]) regardless
	ignoreCLIP setting.  ignoreCLIP now only controls the storage of the
	user provided number to [CLIP].  The old effect of ignoreCLIP was to
	look at the first IE only.  Changed the calls of buildnumber and vnum
	in case of number order network/user, so that [CLIP] is set right.
	If there is an alias for the CLIP number, show alias and number in
	parentheses (new) in "CLIP ..." notice.
