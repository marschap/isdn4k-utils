What ist it?

modilp is a small kernel module providing /proc/isdninfo. This file shows
the connection state of 2 ISDN B-Channels.
The information shown in /proc/isdnlog is written by isdnlog in the states
CONNECT and RELEASE.
For best usage (all devices on the S0 bus shown) you should use a HFCS-based
ISDN card or a second reversed card (s. FAQ).


Installation

  Adjust Makefile for your kernel-gcc
  make
  su -c "insmod modilp"
  cat /proc/isdnlog

  Make isdnlog:

  cd ../..
  # make clean
  make ILP=1
  
  as root, copy bin/isdnlog to /sbin/isdnlog and restart em.
  
  watch /proc/isdnlog
  
  
  to revert to old isdnlog do:
  
  touch isdnlog/processor.c isdnlog/functions.c
  make
  

TODO

Check this with 2.2 and 2.4 kernels.
After this integrate into build process.
Remove PRT_INFO in modilp.c.

Have fun!
