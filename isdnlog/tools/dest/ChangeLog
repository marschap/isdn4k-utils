	* Makefile.in (NO_UTF8): Added backward compatibility for pre UTF-8
	installations.  If NO_UTF8 is set to 1, the destination database is
	created with ISO-8859-1 (latin1) as charset.
	* makedest (csext): As makedest contains some hard coded file names
	it must pay attention to the NO_UTF8 environment variable and append
	.latin1 to the input file names if set to 1.

	* ChangeLog: Started this file.  Pure changes in data files will not
	be noted herein.
