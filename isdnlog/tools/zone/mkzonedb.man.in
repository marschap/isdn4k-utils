.SH NAME
mkzonedb \- Utility create a zone file for isdnlog
.SH SYNOPSIS
mkzonedb -r zonefile -d database [-v] [-V] [-o Oz] [-l len]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkzonedb
reads a text file with zone (area code) information,
and writes it in a special format to the database file
so that other apps such as isdnlog can easily access the data.

This data is used to determine in what "zone" a given area code
is in relation to another, to see what rate applies to a call
between these area codes ("is the call a local call").

This utility is really only used during the building of the isdnlog-data
package, but it may be useful for those who want to create their own
custom tables.
