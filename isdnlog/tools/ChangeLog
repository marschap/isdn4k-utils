	* isdnrate.c (Provider): Rewrote function, returned string has
	now always the length WIDTH.  The providername is truncated if
	necessary. 

	* isdnrate.c (printTable): Allow the first provider in ratefile
	(prefix=0) to appear in first hour range of day without producing
	wrong output.

	* isdnrate.c (printTable): Compare all providers, not only the best
	one when computing hour ranges in table mode (-T).

	* isdnrate.c (printTable): Display hour range ending at midnight
	as ".. 23:59" instead of ".. -1:59".

	* isdnrate.c (printTable): Replaced double2str by printRate, so
	U: tag from ratefile is also used in table mode.

	* isdnrate.c (print_header): Do not print date in table mode.
