	* Makefile.in (NO_UTF8): Added backward compatibility for pre UTF-8
	installations.  If NO_UTF8 is set to 1, intermediate data files are
	created with .latin1 as extension and ISO-8859-1 (latin1) as charset
	using iconv und used for installation and destination database
	generation.  At the moment there is no option in the config dialog
	for this and there is also no configure check for iconv.  With NO_UTF8
	to any value other than 1 or not all, there shall be no changes.

2006-02-04  Tobias Becker  <tobiasb@isdn4linux.de>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): Increased from 4.70 to 4.71.
	This reflects the recently change of the character codeset
	for data files in the source from ISO-8859-15 to UTF8.

2005-02-27  Tobias Becker  <tobiasb@isdn4linux.de>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): Increased from 4.69 to 4.70.
	4.69 was used to collect changes.  4.71 will be used either for the
	next series of changes or for a severe bug fix.

2005-02-23  Tobias Becker  <tobiasb@isdn4linux.de>

	* Makefile.in: Added file tools/rate_skip.o to object file lists.
	Added install instruction for new manual page rate.conf(5).

	* configure.in: Added tools/rate.conf.5.in to list for text
	substitution.  New variables MANDATE_RATE_CONF and VERSION_ISDNLOG
	for text replacement in manual pages.  VERSION_ISDNLOG is set to
	VERSION from Makefile.in by grep.
	* configure: Same changes as for configure.in, generated by a
	patched autconf 2.53, which had been used for former revisions. 

2004-12-10  Tobias Becker  <tobiasb@isdn4linux.de>

	* Makefile.in (NATION): Export this variable to child processes, like
	make in subdirectories.

2004-07-24  Tobias Becker  <tobiasb@isdn4linux.de>

	* Makefile.in: Set version number to 4.69.
