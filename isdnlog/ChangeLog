	* Makefile.in (VERSION): Increased from 4.69 to 4.70.
	4.69 was used to collect changes.  4.71 will be used either for the
	next series of changes or for a severe bug fix.

	* Makefile.in: Added file tools/rate_skip.o to object file lists.
	Added install instruction for new manual page rate.conf(5).

	* configure.in: Added tools/rate.conf.5.in to list for text
	substitution.  New variables MANDATE_RATE_CONF and VERSION_ISDNLOG
	for text replacement in manual pages.  VERSION_ISDNLOG is set to
	VERSION from Makefile.in by grep.
	* configure: Same changes as for configure.in, generated by a
	patched autconf 2.53, which had been used for former revisions.
