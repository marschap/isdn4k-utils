                    Thanks to Brian Moran.

V2.0 - 2000-03-23 - Eicon's divautils included to support new
                    kernel-driver 2.0 
                    Support for 4BRI card.

V1.2 - 2000-02-12 - Added write command to management interface.
                    Increased D-Channel logbuffer. 

V1.1 - 2000-01-26 - New command "eiconctrl isdnlog on|off" for 
                    D-Channel tracing. Necessary for the use of
                    isdnlog. 
                    XLOG traces now come from the card, instead
                    of polling.
