.SH FORMAT
With version 2.0.0 of vbox the recorded files have a new header, that
does not only include compression mode and connection information, but
also information about the caller.

The current headers hold this information:

.in +4
\fBtime\fR of recording the message, 
.br
\fBcompression\fR mode,
.br
\fBCALLER\fR ID,
.br
\fBname\fR,
.br
\fBtelephone\fR number,
.br
\fBcity\fR
.in -4

With this information it's possible for other programs to get the
information about a message. The detailed format is described in the
file libvbox.h as structure vaheader_t (this file is not included in
debian gnu/linux; if you want to develop isdn programs you should get
the source code).
