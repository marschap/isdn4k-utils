# This file is boorwed from the kernel configuration.

# Format of this file: description<nl>variable<nl>helptext<nl><nl>. 
# If the question being documented is of type "choice", we list
# only the first occurring config variable. The help texts
# must not contain empty lines. No variable should occur twice; if it
# does, only the first occurrence will be used by Configure. The lines
# in a help text should be indented two positions. Lines starting with
# `#' are ignored. To be nice to menuconfig, limit your lines to 70
# characters. Use emacs' kfill.el to edit this file or you lose.

Prompt for development and/or incomplete code
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
  Some of the programs in this package may be incomplete or
  instable.
  Unless you intend to help test and develop a feature that
  falls into this category, or you have a situation that requires
  using these features you should probably say N here, which will
  cause this configure script to present you with fewer choices. If
  you say Y here, you will be offered the choice of using features or
  that are currently considered to be in the alpha-test phase.

CONFIG_BUILDX11
  With this option you can disable the installation of all programs
  which require X11. If xmkmf is missing, this option will be
  automatically disabled for you.

CONFIG_KERNELDIR
  Some programs need special include files from non-standard locations
  within the kernel source. The default is /usr/src/linux. Change this
  setting to fit your local environment.

Directory to install binaries
CONFIG_BINDIR
  This option tells the installation process, where to put those
  programs which are usable for ordinary users. The administrative
  programs (those, which are intended for configuration) are
  installed in another directory, configurable in the next option.

Directory to install administrative binaries
CONFIG_SBINDIR
  This option tess the installation process, where to put the
  administrative programs. All other programs are installed in
  another directory, configurable in the previous option.

Directory to install man pages
CONFIG_MANDIR
  This option tells the installation process, where to put the
  man pages. This is usually /usr/man or /usr/local/man. The
  man pages go into some subdirectory below this directory
  depending on the section they belong to.

CONFIG_RUNDIR
  Some applications create special files for managing their
  process IDs. This option selects the directory where to create
  these ".pid" files. Usually this is /var/run.

CONFIG_LOCKDIR
  Some applications create special files for resource locking.
  This option selects the directory where to create these files.
  Usually this is /var/lock.

CONFIG_LOCKFILE
  Some applications create special files for resource locking.
  This option selects the fixed part of name for these files.
  The variable part depends on the application. Usually you
  can accept the "LCK.." default here.

General configuration directory
CONFIG_I4LCONFDIR
  Some of the programs in this package need global configuration
  files. This option tells them where to expect these files.
  During installation, some sample files may be installed there
  also.

CONFIG_CONFFILE
  This is the name of the global configuration file.

CONFIG_CALLERIDFILE
  This option defines the name for the global callerid file.
  In this file, well-known names can be assigned to phone numbers.
  Some of the applications then display the names instead of
  phone numbers.

CONFIG_USERCONFFILE
  In addition to the global config file, some applications allow
  user-specific settings. This option tells, which filename to
  use for these settings.

CONFIG_COUNTRY_PREFIX
  This option defines the prefix to be dialed before the country code
  on international calls.

CONFIG_AREA_PREFIX
  This option defines the prefix to be dialed before the area code
  on national calls.

CONFIG_COUNTRYCODE
  Put your local country code WITHOUT prefix here.

CONFIG_AREACODE
  Put your local area code WITHOUT prefix here.

CONFIG_LIB_AREACODE
  For resolving areacodes to city names, a database library is used.
  With this option, you can select between two database librarys.
  The recommended library is "Areacode", however those who want to reuse
  their old datafiles, can select the old "Avon" library here.

CONFIG_DATADIR
  With this option, the directory for the areacode database and
  the firmware images of the various active cards can be selected.

Build isdnctrl tool
CONFIG_ISDNCTRL
  This program is the main configuration utility for all linklevel
  related configuration such as net-devices, mapping, encapsulation
  etc. This program is documented in isdnctrl (8).

Enable debugging features of isdnctrl
CONFIG_ISDNCTRL_DEBUG
  If enabled, a special feature 'debug' is available with isdnctrl.
  With this feature, isdnctrl is able to dump internal data structures
  of the linklevel part. This feature may be helpful when debugging
  drivers or the linklevel itself.

Enable config file option isdnctrl
CONFIG_ISDNCTRL_CONF
  If enabled, an option to read/write configfiles is build into isdnctrl.
  The manpage is extended automatically.

Build iprofd
CONFIG_IPROFD
  If enabled, iprofd, a special daemon will be built. This daemon is
  used to permanently store profile data from the modem emulator
  into a file whenever an AT&W0 command is given on any ttyI. It also
  reads this file on startup and initializes the profile from its
  contents.
  This program is documented in iprofd (8).

Build telesctrl
CONFIG_TELESCTRL
  This program is used to configure the teles driver (mainly debugging
  options). For the HiSax driver, there is another tool, called
  hisaxctrl. These are essentially the same binary, just with a
  different name.
  This program is documented in telesctrl (8).

Build hisaxctrl
CONFIG_HISAXCTRL
  This program is used to configure the HiSax driver (mainly debugging
  options). For the teles driver, there is another tool, called
  telesctrl. These are essentially the same binary, just with a
  different name.
  This program is documented in hisaxctrl (8).

Build icnctrl
CONFIG_ICNCTRL
  This program is used to configure the ICN driver. With this tool, you
  can add cards, download protocol firmware into cards and configure
  ports, memory, leased-line mode etc. 
  This program is documented in icnctrl (8).

Enable debugging features of icnctrl
CONFIG_ICNCTRL_DEBUG
  If enabled, a special feature 'debug' is available with icnctrl.
  With this feature, icnctrl is able to dump internal data structures
  of the ICN driver. This feature may be helpful when debugging
  the ICN driver.

Build actctrl
CONFIG_ACTCTRL
  This program is used to configure the IBM Active 2000 driver. With
  this tool, you can add cards, download protocol firmware into cards
  and configure ports, irq, D-channel protocol etc. 
  This program is documented in actctrl (8).

Enable debugging features of actctrl
CONFIG_ACTCTRL_DEBUG
  If enabled, a special feature 'debug' is available with actctrl.
  With this feature, actctrl is able to dump internal data structures
  of the IBM Active 2000 driver. This feature may be helpful when
  debugging the driver.

Build pcbitctl
CONFIG_PCBITCTL
  This program is used to configure the pcbit driver. With this tool, you
  can download protocol firmware into cards.
  This program is documented in pcbitctl (8).

CONFIG_AVMCAPICTRL
  This program is used to configure the avm-b1 driver. With this tool
  you can download protocol firmware int cards.
  This program is documented in avmcapictrl (8).

CONFIG_LOOPCTRL
  This program is used to configure the loop driver. This tool is
  marked experimental, since the driver is NOT included in standard
  kernel. It is mainly for testing purposes.
  This program is documented in loopctrl (8).

CONFIG_LOOPCTRL_LOOPDIR
  Since loopctrl uses header files from the source of the ISDN loop
  driver, you have to define the directory where those can be found.

Build imon
CONFIG_IMON
  This is a userlevel program to monitor the activity of isdn4linux.
  It is tty based and uses ncurses to produce a nice screen.
  This program is documented in imon (1).

CONFIG_IMONTTY
  This is a userlevel program to monitor the activity of isdn4linux.
  It is tty based does NOT use (n)curses.

CONFIG_ISDNLOG
  This program is mainly for monitoring activity. It has been extended
  to do a lot of more however. See isdnlog/README for more information.

Install generic man pages
CONFIG_GENMAN
  If enabled, in addition to the tool's man pages, the following generic
  man pages are installed:
  isdninfo.4 ttyI.4 cui.4 isdn_audio.4 isdn_cause.7

Generate FAQ
CONFIG_FAQ
  If enabled, the FAQ, available as html both unpacked and packed with
  zip and gzip are generated. The FAQ is available in English and German.
