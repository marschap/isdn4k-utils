.SH NAME
xmonisdn \- monitor for ISDN network
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmonisdn
[ \-\fItoolkitoption\fP ... ] [ \fI\-option\fP ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I xmonisdn
program displays the status of the ISDN network connection and allows
to start and stop the ISDN subsystem. If the ISDN subsystem is not
active, a window showing a terminal in the foreground and a dashed
terminal in the backgorund is displayed. If the ISDN system is active,
but there is no network connection established, two terminals with
dashed arrows between them is displayed. If there is a incoming
connection or there is dialing in progress, the arrows become more
solid. An outgoing network connection is signaled by solid arrows
between the terminals and the window is inverted. 
If the ISDN subsystem dials out or hangs up, the program beeps to signal
the state change (this can be changed using the 
.I volume 
option).
.PP
Pressing button 2 on the window executes the command
.I @CONFIG_XMONISDN_UPCMD@ start
and pressing button 3 executes
.I @CONFIG_XMONISDN_DOWNCMD@ stop.
@CONFIG_XMONISDN_UPCMD@
should be a shell script that starts and stops the ISDN subsystem;
if the
.ul
route
command is used, xmonisdn must be run as setuid root for this to work.
Alternatively, the script can manipulate the
.ul
isdnctrl dialmode
setting, in which case only permission to access /dev/isdnctrl is needed.
.SH OPTIONS
.I xmonisdn
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options along with the
additional options listed below:
.TP 8
.B \-help
This option indicates that a brief summary of the allowed options should be
printed on the standard error.
.TP 8
.B \-update \fIthenth of a second\fP
This option specifies the frequency in 1/10 of a second at which \fIxmonisdn\fP
should update its display.  If the window is obscured and then exposed,
it will be updated immediately.  The default is 0.5 seconds.
.TP 8
.B \-file \fIfilename\fP
This option specifies the name of the file which should be monitored.  By
default, it watches /dev/isdninfo.
.TP 8
.B \-volume \fIpercentage\fP
This option specifies how loud the bell should be rung when  there is an important status change.
.TP 8
.B \-shape
This option indicates that the xmonisdn window should be shaped if masks for
the  images are given.
.PP
The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments are commonly used with 
.I xmonisdn:
.TP 8
.B \-display \fIdisplay\fP
This option specifies the X server to contact.
.TP 8
.B \-geometry \fIgeometry\fP
This option specifies the preferred size and position of the xmonisdn window.
The icon is 48 pixels wide and 48 pixels high and will be centered in
the window.
.TP 8
.B \-bg \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for the background of the window.  
.TP 8
.B \-bd \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for the border of the window.
.TP 8
.B \-bw \fInumber\fP
This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window.
.TP 8
.B \-fg \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for the foreground of the window.
.TP 8
.B \-rv
This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by swapping
the foreground and background colors.
.TP 8
.B \-xrm \fIresourcestring\fP
This option specifies a resource string to be used.  This is especially
useful for setting resources that do not have separate command line options.
.SH X DEFAULTS
The application class name is xmonisdn.
This program uses the 
.I Netstat
widget.
It understands all of the core resource names and
classes as well as:
.PP

.B file (\fPclass\fB File)
Specifies the name of the file to monitor.  The default is to watch
/dev/isdninfo.
.TP 8
.B width (\fPclass\fB Width)
Specifies the width of the icon.
.TP 8
.B height (\fPclass\fB Height)
Specifies the height of the icon.
.TP 8
.B update (\fPclass\fB Interval)
Specifies the frequency in 1/10 of a second at which the isdninfo file should be checked.
The default is 10.
.TP 8
.B volume (\fPclass\fB Volume)
Specifies how loud the bell should be rung.  The default is 33 percent.
.TP 8
.B foreground (\fPclass\fB Foreground)
Specifies the color for the foreground.
.TP 8
.B reverseVideo (\fPclass\fB ReverseVideo)
Specifies that the foreground and background should be reversed.
.TP 8
.B flip (\fPclass\fB Flip)
Specifies whether or not the image that is shown when there is an outgoing network connection 
should be inverted.  The default is ``true.''

Specifies a bitmap to be shown when the ISDN subsystem is inactive.
The default is netinactive.
.TP 8

Specifies a bitmap to be shown when there is a outgoing network connection. 
The default is netactiveout.
.TP 8

Specifies a bitmap to be shown when the ISDN network is started up. 
The default is netstart.
.TP 8

.SH ACTIONS
The \fINetstat\fP widget provides the following actions for use in event
translations:
.TP 8
.B check()
This action causes the widget to check the isdninfo file and display the appropriate icon.
.TP 8
.B netdown()
This action causes the widget to execute @CONFIG_XMONISDN_DOWNCMD@ stop.
.TP 8
.B netup()
This action causes the widget to execute @CONFIG_XMONISDN_UPCMD@ start.

.fi
.sp
.SH ENVIRONMENT
